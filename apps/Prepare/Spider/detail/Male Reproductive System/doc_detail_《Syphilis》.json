[{"references": null, "title": "Reproductive Urologist and Gynecologist Involvement in Postvasectomy Sperm Retrieval Procedures at American Fertility Clinics.", "abstract": "Abstract\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo evaluate reproductive urologist and reproductive endocrinologist practice patterns for postvasectomy surgical sperm retrieval at American private practice fertility clinics.\nMETHODS:\nPrivate practice American fertility clinics were contacted by telephone and administered a telephone survey. In states with multiple large cities, several clinics in different cities were surveyed. Our primary endpoint was to determine what specialty of physician (urologist or reproductive endocrinology gynecologist) performed sperm retrieval procedures. Secondarily, we inquired about the location that these procedures were performed (urology vs gynecology clinic), type of anesthesia used, and cash cost for the procedure.\nRESULTS:\nTwo hundred and twenty-five infertility clinics were contacted (per state range 2-10). 90.2% (203/225) of clinics responded to our queries. Zero clinics had an on-site urologist. An on-staff gynecologist with reproductive endocrinology training performed postvasectomy sperm retrievals in 9.4% (19/203) of clinics. A urologist \"partnered\" with the infertility clinic performed sperm retrievals at the fertility clinic in 11.8% (24/203) of clinics. 18.7% (38/203) did not offer sperm retrieval on-site, but did have a referral pattern established with a local urologist. Among reproductive endocrinologist performing sperm retrievals, intravenous anesthesia was used in 76.9% (10/13) of clinics. The quoted costs for surgical sperm retrieval performed by a reproductive endocrinologist ranged from $1000 to 10,000.\nCONCLUSION:\nSurgical sperm retrieval postvasectomy performed by an on-site reproductive endocrinologist was offered by 9.4% of contacted fertility clinics. The majority (76.9%) of these cases were routinely performed under intravenous anesthesia. Costs for reproductive endocrinologist performed sperm retrievals varied considerably. The reasons for, and safety of reproductive endocrinologists performing these procedures remains to be determined.\nCopyright © 2019.", "publication": "Urology. 2019 Nov;133:116-120. doi: 10.1016/j.urology.2019.08.019.

We sought to determine if routine prescribing of opioids is necessary for pain control after vasectomy, and if an association exists with persistent use.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\nWe retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients who underwent vasectomy in clinic between April 2017 and March 2018. Patients were stratified into 2 groups, including those initially prescribed opioids and those not receiving opioid prescriptions at the time of vasectomy. The initial pain medication regimen depended on the standard prescription practice of each provider. Encounters with a medical provider for scrotal pain within 30 days, subsequent opioid prescriptions and new persistent opioid prescriptions between 90 and 180 days were compared between the 2 groups using the Fisher exact test.\nRESULTS:\nBetween April 2017 and March 2018 a total of 228 patients underwent clinic vasectomy as performed by 8 urologists. At the time of vasectomy 102 patients received opioid prescriptions and 126 received no opioid prescriptions. There was no statistically significant difference between the opioid and nonopioid groups in encounters for scrotal pain (12.7% vs 18.4%, p = 0.279). The incidence of new persistent opioid use was 7.8% in the opioid cohort compared to 1.5% in the nonopioid cohort (p = 0.046).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nOpioids, which do not appear to be necessary in men who undergo vasectomy, were associated with persistent use in 7.8% of patients at 3 to 6 months.

Since vasectomy is a common and effective form of contraception, these implications are significant. Therefore, we sought to test this association in a large observational cohort.\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo evaluate the potential association between prior vasectomy and the risk of developing prostate cancer.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\nWe evaluated the relationship between vasectomy and prostate cancer in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. Of the 111,914 men, prostate cancer was identified in 13,885 men and vasectomies were performed in 48,657. We used multivariate analysis to examine the relationship between prostate cancer and vasectomy. We also performed propensity score-adjusted and propensity score-matched analysis.\nRESULTS:\nMen utilizing vasectomy were more likely to be ever married, fathers, educated, white, and screened for prostate cancer. During 4,251,863 person-years of follow-up, there was a small association between vasectomy and incident prostate cancer with a hazard ratio of 1.05 (95% CI, 1.01-1.11). However, no significant association was found when looking separately at prostate cancer by grade or stage. Conclusions were similar when using propensity adjustment and matching. Importantly, a significant interaction between vasectomy and PSA screening was identified.\nDISCUSSION:\nEstimates of the association between vasectomy and prostate cancer are sensitive to analytic method underscoring the tenuous nature of the connection. Given the differences between men who do and do not utilize vasectomy, selection bias appears likely to explain any identified association between vasectomy and prostate cancer.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nWith over 20 years of follow-up, no convincing relationship between vasectomy and prostate cancer of any grade was identified.\n© 2019 American Society of Andrology and European Academy of Andrology.", "publication": "Andrology. 2019 Mar;7(2):178-183. doi: 10.1111/andr.12570.

During the procedure, a total of 125 fresh vas deferens samples were obtained and divided into four groups as follows: Group 1: ligation (n = 22), Group 2; ligation and electrocauterization (n = 18), Group 3; 5 mm LSVS (n = 44), Group 4; 10 mm LSVS (n = 41).

Pain was documented using the numerical rating scale (NRS). Spermatic cord block (SCB) was performed on all patients, and success was defined as NRS score ≤1 for >4 h. All patients had failed medical therapy prior to MDSC. All previous procedures for PVPS had been performed elsewhere. Surgical success was defined as a postoperative NRS score of ≤1.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 27 patients with 28 scrotal units underwent MDSC for PVPS. The median (1st quartile; 3rd quartile) follow-up was 10 (2; 16.5) months. The median (range) duration of pain prior to surgery was 57 (8-468) months. Pain was bilateral in 14 (52%), left-sided in eight (30%) and right-sided in five patients (19%). Data on SCB were available for 23 patients, with a success rate of 96%.

The survey questions and 3 clinical scenarios were designed based on the 2012 AUA vasectomy guidelines. Results of the survey were compiled between urologists and nonurologists and then compared with the guideline recommendations.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 23 FMPs and 6 urologists responded. Fewer prevasectomy counseling topics were discussed by FMPs compared with urologists. A variety of vasectomy techniques were used among FMPs. Vas deferens segments were more likely to be sent for histology by FMPs than urologists (65% vs 17%, P = .02). FMPs were more likely to send postvasectomy semen analyses earlier than urologists (P = .02) and more likely to send multiple postvasectomy semen analyses (P = .006) before forgoing alternative contraceptive methods. Regarding the clinical scenario questions, FMPs were more likely to answer discordantly from guideline recommendations compared with urologists.\nCONCLUSION:\nSignificant vasectomy practice pattern heterogeneity still exists among nonurologists surveyed within our institution. The 2012 AUA vasectomy guidelines have yet to be broadly implemented within nonurology practices. Further studies are warranted to investigate national trends in nonurologist vasectomy practice patterns and determine how the guidelines can be better implemented in nonurologic practices.\nCopyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

PVPS is defined as at least 3 months of chronic or intermittent scrotal content pain after a vasectomy procedure once other etiologies for the pain have been ruled out.\nAIM:\nTo systematically review the current literature on the effectiveness of micro-denervation of the spermatic cord (MDSC) for PVPS.\nMETHODS:\nA systematic literature search using PubMed, Scopus, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases for all reports pertaining to PVPS using the Medical Subject Heading terms post vasectomy pain syndrome and micro-denervation of spermatic cord through February 2017.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:\nScrotal content pain after MDSC for PVPS.\nRESULTS:\nThere were nine retrospective studies evaluating MDSC for chronic testicular pain. After omitting repeated series, there were 213 patients who underwent MDSC for chronic orchialgia. Only one study specifically reviewed the outcomes of patients who underwent MDSC for PVPS. In this study, 17 patients underwent MSDC for PVPS, with 13 (76.5%) reporting complete relief of pain at their first follow-up visit. The other four patients had significant improvement in pain and were satisfied with the results. Long-term follow-up data were not available for this study.\nCONCLUSION:\nMDSC remains a valuable approach with high success rates and should be considered for PVPS that is refractory to medical therapy. MDSC appears to have the most success for patients who experience a temporary relief from a cord block and can significantly improve the patient's quality of life and ability to return to daily activities.

Between February 2012 and February 2015, three waves of in-depth interviews were conducted with program administrators at 54 family planning organizations in Texas. Participants described their organization's vasectomy service model and factors that influenced how frequently vasectomy was provided. Interview transcripts were coded and analyzed using a theme-based approach. Service models and barriers to providing vasectomy were compared by organization type (e.g., women's health center, public health clinic) and receipt of Title X funding. Two thirds of organizations did not offer vasectomy on-site or pay for referrals with family planning funding; nine organizations frequently provided vasectomy. Organizations did not widely offer vasectomy because they could not find providers that would accept the low reimbursement for the procedure or because they lacked funding for men's reproductive health care. Respondents often did not perceive men's reproductive health care as a service priority and commented that men, especially Latinos, had limited interest in vasectomy. Although organizations of all types reported barriers, women's health centers and Title X-funded organizations more frequently offered vasectomy by conducting tailored outreach to men and vasectomy providers.

We conducted an extensive review of the vasectomy research literature and programmatic reports, published between April 2005 and April 2015, to synthesize barriers and facilitators to vasectomy adoption. Of the more than 230 documents initially retrieved in our search, we ultimately included 75 documents in our review and synthesized the findings according to the Supply-Enabling Environment-Demand (SEED) Programming Model. Regarding promoting demand for vasectomy services, we found there was a general lack of awareness about the method among both men and women, which often fueled erroneous assumptions about how vasectomy affects men. Several types of programmatic activities directly addressed knowledge gaps and negative misperceptions, including community-based and mass media communications, employer-based promotion, and group counseling. For supply of services, the lack of or inaccurate knowledge about vasectomy was also prevalent among providers, particularly among community-based health workers. Programmatic activities to improve service delivery included the use of evidence-based vasectomy techniques such as no-scalpel vasectomy, whole-site trainings, task shifting, cascade training, and mobile outreach. Finally, programmatic approaches to building a more enabling environment included engagement of governments and other community and religious leaders as well as campaigns with gender transformative messaging that countered common myths and encouraged men's positive engagement in family planning and reproductive health. In summary, a successful vasectomy program is comprised of the mutually reinforcing components of continual demand for services and access to and supply of well-trained providers. In addition, there is an underlying need for enabling policies within the cultural and gender environments that extend beyond vasectomy and include men not just as default partners of female family planning clients but as equal beneficiaries of family planning and reproductive health programs in their own right. Accelerating progress toward meaningful integration of vasectomy into a comprehensive contraceptive method mix is only possible when political and financial will are aligned and support the logistical and promotional activities of a male reproductive health agenda.\n© Shattuck et al.", "publication": "Glob Health Sci Pract. 2016 Dec 28;4(4):647-660. doi: 10.9745/GHSP-D-16-00235.

We utilized a logistic regression model to determine if vasectomy utilization varies based on offspring sex ratio while accounting for known factors that impact vasectomy utilization.\nRESULTS:\nOf these men, 30,927 (30.8%) underwent vasectomy. Marital status, race, age, education level, region or state, and number of offspring were all significantly correlated with vasectomy utilization (P < .01). The sex ratio for vasectomized fathers (51.3%) was significantly higher than for fathers who had not undergone vasectomy (50.7%, P < .01). This difference remained even after we stratified by the total number of offspring: vasectomized men with 4 or more children had a sex ratio of 947 girls per 1000 boys, whereas the no vasectomy group had a sex ratio of 983 girls per 1000 boys (P < .01). For men with at least 2 children, each additional son increased the likelihood of vasectomy by 4% (P < .01), whereas each additional daughter led to a 2% decrease in vasectomy utilization (P = .03).\nCONCLUSION:\nVasectomized fathers have a higher proportion of sons compared with non-vasectomized fathers, suggesting that offspring sex ratio is associated with a man's decision to undergo vasectomy. Further research is indicated to understand how offspring sex ratio impacts a man's contraceptive decisions.\nCopyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Vasectomy reversal procedures were identified by 3 current procedure terminology (CPT) codes: 55400 (vasovasostomy), 54900 (epididymovasostomy, unilateral), and 54901 (epididymovasostomy, bilateral). Demographic data were obtained and reviewed. Multivariate analysis determined the factors influencing the performance of surgical approach.\nRESULTS:\nThere were 5167 urologists who submitted case logs for 2008-2014, and 9.4% (486) had performed at least one vasectomy reversal procedure. General urologists accounted for the highest overall volume of vasectomy reversal procedures. Andrology-trained urologists performed a higher volume of vasovasostomy per surgeon, and bilateral epididymovasostomy constituted a greater portion of their E-V practice. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that being in recertification years, being younger in age, practicing in the South Central, Southeast, and Western regions, and practicing in the largest and smallest practice areas were associated with being more likely to perform a vasectomy reversal procedure.\nCONCLUSION:\nMicrosurgical vasectomy reversals are putatively considered technically challenging and reserved for fellowship-trained urologists, and the majority of vasectomy reversal surgeries were performed by general urologists. Given the known association between microsurgical technique and improved outcomes, greater emphasis should be placed on microsurgical training during urology residency.\nCopyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Between October 2016 and March 2017, we conducted a cross-sectional study examining the prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis and its association with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) other than HIV among pregnant women visiting antenatal clinics in Kisantu health zone, Democratic Republic of Congo. An extensive sociodemographic and clinical survey was administered to consenting participants, with urine samples and vaginal swabs collected to deduce active schistosomiasis and STIs, respectively. In total, 17.4% of expectant mothers were infected with Schistosoma haematobium, 3.1% with Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), 1.4% with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), and 14.6% with Trichomonas vaginalis (TV).

In the trial, participants were randomly allocated to receive a text message with the web link of an e-STI testing and results service (intervention group) or a text message with the link of a website listing the locations, contact details and websites of seven local sexual health clinics (control group). We analysed a subsample of 528 trial participants who reported never testing for STIs at baseline. Outcomes were self-reported STI testing at 6 weeks, verified by patient record checks, and time from randomisation to completion of an STI test.\nRESULTS:\nUptake of STI testing among 'never testers' almost doubled. At 6 weeks, 45.3% of the intervention completed at least one test (chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and HIV), compared with 24.1% of the control (relative risk [RR] 1.88, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.40, p<0.001). For chlamydia and gonorrhoea testing combined, uptake was 44.3% in the intervention versus 24.1% in controls (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.36, p<0.001). The intervention reduced time to any STI test (restricted mean survival time: 29.0 days vs 36.3 days, p<0.001) at a time horizon of 42 days. CONCLUSIONS : e-STI testing increased uptake of STI testing and reduced time to test among a young population of 'never testers' recruited in community settings. Although encouraging, questions remain on how best to manage the additional demand generated by e-STI testing in a challenging funding environment.

Different aspects of MCRPC research, including the countries/territories, institutions, journals, authors, research areas, funding agencies and author keywords, were analyzed.\nRESULTS:\nThe number of annual MCRPC publications increased rapidly after 2010. American researchers played a vital role in this increase, as they published the most publications. The most productive institution was Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. De Bono, JS (the United Kingdom [UK]) and Scher, HI (the United States of America [USA]) were the two most productive authors. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded the largest number of published papers.

We will evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture and moxibustion in the treatment of pain caused by prostate cancer using a clinical randomized parallel control method.\nMETHODS/DESIGN:\nThis pragmatic randomized controlled trial will recruit 120 patients who are diagnosed with prostate cancer. Simple randomization to conventional drug treatment with a 1:1 allocation ratio will be used. Based on the patient's pain location and the primary lesion, the acupuncture needle insertion position was determined according to the principle of local selection of acupoints.

We aimed to investigate whether novel imaging using prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET-CT might improve accuracy and affect management.\nMETHODS:\nIn this multicentre, two-arm, randomised study, we recruited men with biopsy-proven prostate cancer and high-risk features at ten hospitals in Australia. Patients were randomly assigned to conventional imaging with CT and bone scanning or gallium-68 PSMA-11 PET-CT. First-line imaging was done within 21 days following randomisation. Patients crossed over unless three or more distant metastases were identified. The primary outcome was accuracy of first-line imaging for identifying either pelvic nodal or distant-metastatic disease defined by the receiver-operating curve using a predefined reference-standard including histopathology, imaging, and biochemistry at 6-month follow-up. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ANZCTR12617000005358.\nFINDINGS:\nFrom March 22, 2017 to Nov 02, 2018, 339 men were assessed for eligibility and 302 men were randomly assigned. 152 (50%) men were randomly assigned to conventional imaging and 150 (50%) to PSMA PET-CT. Of 295 (98%) men with follow-up, 87 (30%) had pelvic nodal or distant metastatic disease. PSMA PET-CT had a 27% (95% CI 23-31) greater accuracy than that of conventional imaging (92% [88-95] vs 65% [60-69]; p<0·0001). We found a lower sensitivity (38% [24-52] vs 85% [74-96]) and specificity (91% [85-97] vs 98% [95-100]) for conventional imaging compared with PSMA PET-CT. Subgroup analyses also showed the superiority of PSMA PET-CT (area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve 91% vs 59% [32% absolute difference; 28-35] for patients with pelvic nodal metastases, and 95% vs 74% [22% absolute difference; 18-26] for patients with distant metastases). First-line conventional imaging conferred management change less frequently (23 [15%] men [10-22] vs 41 [28%] men [21-36]; p=0·008) and had more equivocal findings (23% [17-31] vs 7% [4-13]) than PSMA PET-CT did. Radiation exposure was 10·9 mSv (95% CI 9·8-12·0) higher for conventional imaging than for PSMA PET-CT (19·2 mSv vs 8·4 mSv; p<0·001). We found high reporter agreement for PSMA PET-CT (κ=0·87 for nodal and κ=0·88 for distant metastases). In patients who underwent second-line image, management change occurred in seven (5%) of 136 patients following conventional imaging, and in 39 (27%) of 146 following PSMA PET-CT.\nINTERPRETATION:\nPSMA PET-CT is a suitable replacement for conventional imaging, providing superior accuracy, to the combined findings of CT and bone scanning.\nFUNDING:\nMovember and Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia.

Biopsies performed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) targeting may reduce the misclassification of prostate cancer in men with MRI-visible lesions.\nMETHODS:\nMen with MRI-visible prostate lesions underwent both MRI-targeted and systematic biopsy. The primary outcome was cancer detection according to grade group (i.e., a clustering of Gleason grades). Grade group 1 refers to clinically insignificant disease; grade group 2 or higher, cancer with favorable intermediate risk or worse; and grade group 3 or higher, cancer with unfavorable intermediate risk or worse. Among the men who underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy, upgrading and downgrading of grade group from biopsy to whole-mount histopathological analysis of surgical specimens were recorded. Secondary outcomes were the detection of cancers of grade group 2 or higher and grade group 3 or higher, cancer detection stratified by previous biopsy status, and grade reclassification between biopsy and radical prostatectomy.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 2103 men underwent both biopsy methods; cancer was diagnosed in 1312 (62.4%) by a combination of the two methods (combined biopsy), and 404 (19.2%) underwent radical prostatectomy. Cancer detection rates on MRI-targeted biopsy were significantly lower than on systematic biopsy for grade group 1 cancers and significantly higher for grade groups 3 through 5 (P<0.01 for all comparisons). Combined biopsy led to cancer diagnoses in 208 more men (9.9%) than with either method alone and to upgrading to a higher grade group in 458 men (21.8%). However, if only MRI-target biopsies had been performed, 8.8% of clinically significant cancers (grade group ≥3) would have been misclassified. Among the 404 men who underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy, combined biopsy was associated with the fewest upgrades to grade group 3 or higher on histopathological analysis of surgical specimens (3.5%), as compared with MRI-targeted biopsy (8.7%) and systematic biopsy (16.8%).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nAmong patients with MRI-visible lesions, combined biopsy led to more detection of all prostate cancers. However, MRI-targeted biopsy alone underestimated the histologic grade of some tumors. After radical prostatectomy, upgrades to grade group 3 or higher on histopathological analysis were substantially lower after combined biopsy.

In the present study, we examined the expression of SNHG7 in prostate cancer tissues and in paired adjacent normal prostate tissues, and we further explored the clinical significance and prognostic value of SNHG7 in prostate cancer patients.A total of 127 prostate cancer tissues were collected from prostate cancer patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between April 2011 and March 2019 at the department of urology, Pudong New Area People's Hospital. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction experiment was performed to detect the relative expressions of SNHG7 in the prostate cancer tissues and normal prostate tissues. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to create survival curves and the log-rank test was used to determine statistical significance. A Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to evaluate the prognostic factors in univariate and multivariate analyses.Compared with paired adjacent normal prostatic tissues, SNHG7 expression was increased in prostate cancer tissues (P < .001).

The aim of this study was to determine whether the treatment dose-volume histogram (DVH) agrees with the planned dose to organs at risk (OAR).\nMETHODS:\n41 low-intermediate risk prostate cancer patients were treated with SABR using a linac based technique. Dose prescribed was 35 Gy in five fractions delivered on alternate days, planned using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with 10X flattening filter free (FFF). On treatment, prostate was matched to fiducial markers on cone beam CT (CBCT). OAR were retrospectively delineated on 205 pre-treatment CBCT images.

There was no statistically significant difference in median rectal volume at each of the five treatment scans compared to the planning scan (p = 0.99). This was also the case for median bladder volume (p = 0.79). The median dose received by rectum and bladder at each fraction was higher than planned, at the majority of dose levels.

PTT rates varied by study, ranging from 10-40%. PTT was less severe (based on number of trichiatic eyelashes) than initial trichiasis for 72% of those developing PTT, and only 2% of eyelids were worse at follow up than pre-operatively. Eyelids with central only-trichiasis pre-operatively had lower rates of PTT than eyelids with peripheral only trichiasis in each of the three trials that included severe TT cases. 10% of eyelids with peripheral trichiasis pre-operatively that develop PTT have central TT post-operatively.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:\nPre-operative central trichiasis is less likely than peripheral trichiasis to be associated with subsequent PTT. Regardless of type of surgery, surgeon skill levels, or pre-operative trichiasis severity, the presence of peripheral trichiasis pre-operatively is associated with higher rates of PTT.

It is unclear what mediates this mortality reduction, but one possibility is that antibiotics function as growth promoters for young children.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS:\n24 rural Ethiopian communities that had received biannual mass azithromycin distributions over the previous four years were enrolled in a parallel-group, cluster-randomized trial. Communities were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either continuation of biannual oral azithromycin (20mg/kg for children, 1 g for adults) or to no programmatic antibiotics over the 36 months of the study period. All community members 6 months and older were eligible for the intervention. The primary outcome was ocular chlamydia; height and weight were measured as secondary outcomes on children less than 60 months of age at months 12 and 36. Study participants were not masked; anthropometrists were not informed of the treatment allocation. Anthropometric measurements were collected for 282 children aged 0-36 months at the month 12 assessment and 455 children aged 0-59 months at the month 36 assessment, including 207 children who had measurements at both time points. After adjusting for age and sex, children were slightly but not significantly taller in the biannually treated communities (84.0 cm, 95%CI 83.2-84.8, in the azithromycin-treated communities vs. 83.7 cm, 95%CI 82.9-84.5, in the untreated communities; mean difference 0.31 cm, 95%CI -0.85 to 1.47, P = 0.60).

Neurosyphilis-attributed deaths in young patients have grown exponentially in the past decade, yet there have been few studies on the early stages of neurosyphilis.\nPATIENT CONCERNS:\nA young male patient with syphilitic cerebral arteritis was evaluated in our clinic for the clinical signs of progressive ischemic stroke.\nDIAGNOSIS:\nThe progression of syphilitic cerebral arteritis was observed through computed tomography imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiogram, and transcranial color Doppler. The pathological changes and clinical outcomes were reviewed. In this specific case, the development of syphilitic cerebral arteritis was dynamic, continuous, and rapid. The pathogenesis was related to Heubner arteritis, in which the formation of a mural thrombus (MT) causes the severe obstruction of blood flow without complete occlusion, leading to an increased risk of infarction. In this patient, formation of the MT resulted in the infarction of the smaller vessels and narrowing of the larger vessels. The partial dislodgment of the MT from the arterial wall of the larger vessels occluded the smaller vessels, leading to infarction.\nINTERVENTIONS:\nStandard pharmacotherapy for the treatment of the cerebral infarction and a single course of penicillin were applied.\nOUTCOMES:\nMuscle strength was recovered. The Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15, whereas the NIH Stroke Scale score was 0. The increase in blood flow of the right MCA was accompanied by severe stenosis with compensation of the anterior communicating artery. In addition, moderate to severe stenosis of the right vertebral artery and the basilar artery was suspected. There was a possibility that the right posterior communicating artery was recruited for compensation.\nCONCLUSION:\nProgressive stroke was the initial symptom of the neurosyphilis.

However, its intramuscular (IM) administration is associated with pain at the site of injection. The dilution of PGB with local anesthetics is recommended in some guidelines, but the evidence that supports it, particularly in adults and in HIV infection, is scarce. Preliminary clinical experience also suggests that the IM administration of PGB through increased needle gauges might improve its tolerability. The aim of the study to identify less painful ways of administering IM PGB in the treatment of syphilis in adults.\nMETHODS:\nMulticenter, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial in patients diagnosed with primary syphilis that required a single IM injection of PGB 2400,00 IU. Patients were randomized to receive PGB diluted with 0.5 mL mepivacaine 1% (MV) or PGB alone, and both groups either with a long 19G or short 21G IM needle. The primary objective was the effect on local pain immediately after the administration through a visual scale questionnaire on pain (0 to 10).\nRESULTS:\nOne hundred eight patients were included, 27 in each group. Ninety-four (94.4%) were male, and 41.7% were also HIV-infected. Mean age 36.6 years (SD 11). Significant differences in immediate pain intensity were observed when comparing the long 19G group with anesthesia (mean pain intensity, [MPI] 2.92 [CI 95% 1.08-4.07]) vs long 19G without anesthesia (MPI 5.56 [CI 95% 4.39-6.73), p < 0.001; and also between short 21G group with anesthesia (MPI 3.36 [CI 95% 2.22-4.50]) vs short 21G without anesthesia (MPI 5.06 [CI 95% 3.93-6.19]), p = 0.015). No significant differences in immediate pain were observed between 19G and 21G in the presence or absence of anesthesia (p = 1.0 in both cases). No differences were found between study arms after 6 and 24 h.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThe IM administration of 1% mepivacaine-diluted PGB induces significantly less immediate local pain as compared to PGB alone. The needle gauge did not have any effect on the pain. Based on these results, we suggest anesthetic-diluted IM PGB as the standard treatment for primary syphilis.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION:\nEudraCT 2014-003969-24 (Date of registration 18/09/2014).", "publication": "BMC Infect Dis. 2019 Oct 23;19(1):883. doi: 10.1186/s12879-019-4490-5.", "topic": "Syphilis", "authors": ["Estrada V", "Santiago E", "Cabezas I", "Cotano JL", "Carrió JC", "Fuentes-Ferrer M", "Vera M", "Ayerdi O", "Rodríguez C", "López L", "Cabello N", "Núñez MJ", "Puerta T", "Sagastagoitia I", "Del Romero J"], "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6813081/"}, {"references": null, "title": "Congenital Syphilis Misdiagnosed as Suspected Nonaccidental Trauma.", "abstract": "Abstract\nCongenital syphilis (CS) is a preventable infection, yet the incidence has surged to the highest rates in 20 years.

We present one such case of an infant admitted twice at 3 and 4 months of age with long bone fractures and suspected nonaccidental trauma. On her second presentation, several additional symptoms prompted evaluation for and eventual diagnosis of CS. In this case, it is demonstrated that an isolated long bone fracture can be a first presentation of CS, with other classic findings possibly appearing later. Pediatric providers should be familiar with the varied presentations of CS in older children, including the radiographic findings that we describe.
