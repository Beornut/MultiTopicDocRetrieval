It has been adopted by 14 countries with high HIV prevalence and low circumcision rates. The 60.0% protective efficacy of VMMC has come with misconceptions in some societies in Malawi, hence VMMC clients may opt for risky sexual practices owing to its perceived protective effect. The study estimated proportion of circumcised men engaging in risky sexual behaviors post-VMMC, assessed knowledge on VMMC protective effect and identified socio-demographic factors associated with risky sexual practices.\nMETHOD:\nA cross sectional study was conducted at two sites of Mzuzu city. Systematic random sampling was used to select 322 participants aged 18-49 who had undergone VMMC. The independent variables included age, location, occupation, religion, marital status and education. Outcome variables were non condom use, having multiple sexual partners and engaging in transactional sex. Data from questionnaires was analyzed using Pearson's chi square test and logistic regression.\nRESULTS:\nOut of 322 respondents, 84.8% (273) understood the partial protection offered by VMMC in HIV prevention. Ninety-six percent of the participants self-reported continued use of condoms post VMMC. Overall 23.7-38.3% participants self-reported engaging in risky sexual practices post VMMC, 23.7% (76) had more than one sexual partner; 29.2% (94) paid for sex while 39.9% (n = 187) did not use a condom.

There is a concern among practitioners that pain of injecting analgesics to neonates prior to circumcision could as well be the same as the pain of the procedure. This has made many reluctant to offer effective analgesia for circumcision. If eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (EMLA) provides analgesia comparable to dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB), it will obviate needle prick and encourage analgesia use in neonatal circumcision.\nAIM:\nTo determine how the analgesic efficacy of EMLA compares with that of DPNB in neonatal plastibell circumcision.\nMETHODS:\nA prospective study of 110 male neonates for plastibell circumcision randomized into two groups: A and B, of 55 each, received EMLA or DPNB as analgesia prior to circumcision, respectively. The pulse rates and SpO2 were recorded with pulse oximeter pre-procedural and at four stages of the procedure (adhesiolysis, dorsal slit, tying, and excision) for each neonate. Also the modification of neonatal infant pain scale (NIPS) was recorded during the procedure.\nRESULTS:\nThere were differential changes in SpO2 (lower absolute mean values) and pulse rate (higher absolute mean values) for neonates who received EMLA when compared with DPNB before the procedure. These differences were significant with SpO2 at adhesiolysis (91.0% and 95.0%), dorsal slitting (90.9% and 94.7%), and excision stages (93.4% and 95.3), respectively (P < 0.05). They were also significant with the pulse rates at adhesiolysis (167.9 and 158.6), dorsal slitting (174.3 and 161.7), and tying stages (182.2 and 169.0), respectively (P values = 0.013, 0.015, and 0.044, respectively). This shows DPNB is better than EMLA. However, the difference was not significant at the tying stage with SpO2 and at excision stage with PR (P > 0.05).\nCONCLUSION:\nEMLA produces analgesic effect. However, it does not provide effective analgesia for plastibell circumcision in neonates.

Since 2007, VMMC has been a key component of the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief's (PEPFAR) strategy to mitigate the HIV epidemic in countries with high HIV prevalence and low circumcision rates. To ensure intended effects, PEPFAR sets ambitious annual circumcision targets and provides funding to implementation partners to deliver local VMMC services. In Kenya to date, 1.9 million males have been circumcised; in 2017, 60% of circumcisions were among 10-14-year-olds. We conducted a qualitative field study to learn more about VMMC program implementation in Kenya.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:\nThe study setting was a region in Kenya with high HIV prevalence and low male circumcision rates. From March 2017 through April 2018, we carried out in-depth interviews with 29 VMMC stakeholders, including \"mobilizers\", HIV counselors, clinical providers, schoolteachers, and policy professionals. Additionally, we undertook observation sessions at 14 VMMC clinics while services were provided and observed mobilization activities at 13 community venues including, two schools, four public marketplaces, two fishing villages, and five inland villages. Analysis of interview transcripts and observation field notes revealed multiple unintended consequences linked to the pursuit of targets. Ebbs and flows in the availability of school-age youths together with the drive to meet targets may result in increased burdens on clinics, long waits for care, potentially misleading mobilization practices, and deviations from the standard of care.\nCONCLUSION:\nOur findings indicate shortcomings in the quality of procedures in VMMC programs in a low-resource setting, and more importantly, that the pursuit of ambitious public health targets may lead to compromised service delivery and protocol adherence.

Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) is a key intervention that can substantially reduce heterosexual transmission-the primary mode of transmission across the continent. There is limited research, however, on what factors may contribute to the efficient and high-quality execution of such programs.\nMETHODS:\nWe analyzed a multi-country, multi-stage random sample of 108 health facilities providing VMMC services in sub-Saharan Africa in 2012 and 2013. The survey collected information on inputs, outputs, process quality and management practices from facilities providing VMMC services. We analyzed the relationship between management practices, quality (measured through provider vignettes) and efficiency (estimated through data envelopment analysis) using Generalized Linear Models and Mixed-effects Models. Applying multivariate regression models, we assessed the relationship between management indices and efficiency and quality of VMMC services.\nRESULTS:\nAcross countries, both efficiency and quality varied widely. After adjusting for type of facility, country and scale, performance-base funding was negatively correlated with efficiency -0.156 (p < 0.05). In our analysis, we did not find any significant relationships between quality and management practices.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nNo significant relationship was found between process quality and management practices across 108 VMMC facilities.

Compared to conventional surgical circumcision, the ShangRing procedure is shorter, does not require suturing and gives better cosmetic outcomes. After a pilot evaluation of ShangRing in 2011, Kenya conducted an active surveillance for adverse events associated with its use from 2016-2018 to further assess its safety, uptake and to identify any operational bottlenecks to its widespread use based on data from a larger pool of procedures in routine health care settings.\nMETHODS:\nFrom December 2017 to August 2018, HIV-negative VMMC clients aged 13 years or older seeking VMMC at six sites across five counties in Kenya were offered ShangRing under injectable local anesthetic as an alternative to conventional surgical circumcision. Providers described both procedures to clients before letting them make a choice. Outcome measures recorded for clients who chose ShangRing included the proportions who were clinically eligible, had successful device placement, experienced adverse events (AEs), or failed to return for device removal. Clients failing to return for follow up were sought through phone calls, text messages or home visits to ensure removal and complete information on adverse events.\nRESULTS:\nOut of 3,692 eligible clients 1,079 (29.2%) chose ShangRing; of these, 11 (1.0%) were excluded due to ongoing clinical conditions, 17 (1.6%) underwent conventional surgery due to lack of appropriate device size at the time of the procedure, 97.3% (1051/1079) had ShangRing placement. Uptake of ShangRing varied from 11% to 97% across different sites. There was one severe AE, a failed ShangRing placement (0.1%) managed by conventional wound suturing, plus two moderate AEs (0.2%), post removal wound dehiscence and bleeding, that resolved without sequelae. The overall AE rate was 0.3%. All clients returned for device removal from fifth to eleventh day after placement.\nCONCLUSION:\nShangRing circumcision is effective and safe in the Kenyan context but its uptake varies widely in different settings. It should be rolled out under programmatic implementation for eligible males to take advantage of its unique benefits and the freedom of choice beyond conventional surgical MMC.

Bibliographies of these yielded 101 more. After evaluation we found: Claims that MC carries high risk were contradicted by low frequency of adverse events that were virtually all minor and easily treated with complete resolution. Claims that MC causes psychological harm were contradicted by studies finding no such harm. Claims that MC impairs sexual function and pleasure were contradicted by high-quality studies finding no adverse effect. Claims disputing the medical benefits of MC were contradicted by a large body of high-quality evidence indicating protection against a wide range of infections, dermatological conditions, and genital cancers in males and the female sexual partners of men. Risk-benefit analyses reported that benefits exceed risks by 100-200 to 1. To maximize benefits and minimize risks, the evidence supported early infant MC rather than arguments that the procedure should be delayed until males are old enough to decide for themselves. Claims that MC of minors is unethical were contradicted by balanced evaluations of ethical issues supporting the rights of children to be provided with low-risk, high-benefit interventions such as MC for better health. Expert evaluations of case-law supported the legality of MC of minors. Other data demonstrated that early infant MC is cost-saving to health systems.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nArguments opposing MC are supported mostly by low-quality evidence and opinion, and are contradicted by strong scientific evidence.\n© 2019 The Authors.

It has been shown to be faster than conventional circumcision with comparable adverse event (AE) rates and high client satisfaction. Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) has been shown to dramatically reduce the risk of HIV acquisition in males. However, the fear of pain during circumcision is an important barrier to uptake. Use of topical anesthesia thus presents an opportunity to address this.\nOBJECTIVES:\nWe sought to evaluate the safety, effectiveness and acceptability of the use of topical anaesthesia with ShangRing circumcision of men and boys 10 years of age and above.\nMETHODS:\nParticipants were randomised 2:1 to receive topical or injectable anaesthesia. All participants underwent no-flip ShangRing circumcision. The primary outcome measure was pain. Secondary outcomes included ease of use of topical versus injectable anaesthesia, AEs and participant satisfaction.\nRESULTS:\nCompared to the topical group, participants in the injectable group reported significantly more pain on administration of the anesthesia and at approximately 20 minutes after the procedure. In the topical group, sufficient anaesthesia with topical cream was not achieved in 21 (9.3%) cases before the start of the procedure; in another 6 (2.6%), supplementary injectable anaesthesia was required as the circumcision was being carried out. The AE rate was significantly lower (p<0.01) in the topical (0%) vs. the injectable group (4.2%). The most common AE was pain during the post-operative period.

In recent years epidemiological studies indicate the deterioration of semen parameters: reduction of ejaculate volume, sperm count, and mobility, as well as abnormalities in their morphology. Male infertility can result from many different agents, such as: anatomical or genetic abnormalities, systemic or neurological diseases, infections, trauma, iatrogenic injury, gonadotoxins and development of sperm antibodies and lifestyle (especially obesity, heat and tobacco smoking). It is well documented that adverse changes in male fertility also seem to be associated with environmental exposure to different substances, especially endocrine active factors, known as xenoestrogens, and among these metal ions, known as metalloestrogens, are very important. The role of some metalloestrogens in various diseases, both in women and men, is known and particularly well-proven in women, but still little is known about their role in the regulation of male reproductive potential. Thus we decided to analyse the available information exploring this problem. The review was carried out using the Medline and Google Scholar databases, using the keywords: xenoestrogens, metalloestrogens, male fertility, semen quality, male reproductive potential, mechanisms of metalloestrogen action, environmental pollution and the name of the particular metal. Articles published between 2000 - 2019 have been taken into account, including human and vertebrate animal studies and cell lines. The aim of this review is to discuss the role and mechanisms of action of fifteen metalloestrogens in the human organism, as well as in animal models, and cell cultures, paying special attention to their influence on the physiology of male reproductive health, according to the current state of knowledge. The role of certain metals in human reproduction is still poorly investigated and for some of them only single studies are available.

While the underlying cause of obesity-related male hypogonadism is multi-factorial, here, we investigated the impact of dietary fat on testicular endocrine function. Ingestion of a high-fat \"fast food\" mixed meal, a common practice for obese men, produced a 25% fall in serum testosterone within an hour of eating, with levels remaining suppressed below fasting baseline for up to 4 hr. These changes in serum testosterone were not associated with any significant changes in serum gonadotrophins. The nadir in serum testosterone preceded the post-prandial increase in serum IL-6/IL-17 by several hours, suggesting that inflammation was unlikely the cause. Furthermore, intravenous administration of fat (Intralipid) had no impact on testosterone levels, while an identical oral dose of fat did suppress testosterone.

Regarding the impact of IR on spermatogenesis, spermatogonia are less susceptible to the occurrence of DNA damage after exposition to IR, but are characterized by slower DNA repair compared to somatic cells. Damage to the genes after exposure to IR is possible at each stage of spermatogenesis; however, haploidal spermatids show the highest radiosensitivity in this respect. The genetic risk of the cells differentiating during spermatogenesis is limited to one cycle of spermatogenesis, whereas the genetic instability may persist for the whole period of life, and DNA damage induced by IR may be transmitted to future generations. The minimum dose causing detectable DNA damage was 30 Gy. While exceeding this dose, the number of single-strand DNA breaks increases. Among males exposed to IR, a decrease was observed in sperm motility and in the percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa as well as in an intensification of vacuolization. The genetic material in the sperm of these males showed higher fragmentation and methylation of genomic DNA.\nCONCLUSION:\nIn the context of the epidemiological situation concerning the prevalence of infertility, while assessing the health effects of exposure to IR from artificial, including medical sources, the reproductive risk should be considered.", "authors": ["Wdowiak A", "Skrzypek M", "Stec M", "Panasiuk L"], "publication": "Ann Agric Environ Med. 2019 Jun 17;26(2):210-216. doi: 10.26444/aaem/106085.

Among the several ions, HCO3- and H+ have a central role, mainly due to their role on pH homeostasis. In the male reproductive tract, the major players in pH regulation and homeodynamics are carbonic anhydrases (CAs), HCO3- membrane transporters (solute carrier 4-SLC4 and solute carrier 26-SLC26 family transporters), Na+-H+ exchangers (NHEs), monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) and voltage-gated proton channels (Hv1). CAs and these membrane transporters are widely distributed throughout the male reproductive tract, where they play essential roles in the ionic balance of tubular fluids. CAs are the enzymes responsible for the production of HCO3- which is then transported by membrane transporters to ensure the maturation, storage, and capacitation of the spermatozoa. The transport of H+ is carried out by NHEs, Hv1, and MCTs and is essential for the electrochemical balance and for the maintenance of the pH within the physiological limits along the male reproductive tract. Alterations in HCO3- production and transport of ions have been associated with some male reproductive dysfunctions. Herein, we present an up-to-date review on the distribution and role of the main intervenient on pH homeodynamics in the fluids throughout the male reproductive tract. In addition, we discuss their relevance for the establishment of the male reproductive potential.", "authors": ["Bernardino RL", "Carrageta DF", "Sousa M", "Alves MG", "Oliveira PF"], "publication": "Cell Mol Life Sci. 2019 Oct;76(19):3783-3800. doi: 10.1007/s00018-019-03170-w.

Such experts are well positioned to provide affirming, comprehensive services, including education, hormonal interventions, menstrual management, contraception, and various gynecological procedures. Early medical guidance and support for the TGD community has been associated with long-term positive emotional and physical health outcomes. In this article medical interventions that reproductive health experts can offer to their TGD patients are discussed.\nCopyright © 2020 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology.
