We highlight some of the more promising treatments that are furthest along in development.\nRECENT FINDINGS:\nPatients with dry AMD have long been hoping for a highly efficacious treatment that may slow disease progression or even help regain vision. Patients with wet AMD have many effective treatment options but still there are those who have suboptimal responses or are burdened by the high frequency of treatment. We detail exciting new concepts and targets for novel medications. Specifically, for dry AMD we discuss research looking at complement inhibition, neuroprotection, visual cycle modulators, cell-based therapies, and anti-inflammatory agents. For wet AMD we summarize new, potentially more durable anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents, extended release options, and gene therapy.\nSUMMARY:\nThere are promising new strategies for AMD. Many of the potential new treatments are in or have recently completed phase 2 or phase 3 clinical trials with promising results thus far, including some that have received US Food and Drug Administration approval.

The pathogenesis is multifactorial and complex. The pharmacotherapy of DME addresses both the inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by the intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors and inflammatory processes by the intravitreal application of steroids. Several trials have been published reporting on the efficacy and safety of these treatments.Areas covered: This review discusses original research articles including basic science and clinical studies as well as review articles focusing on the role of inflammation and VEGF expression in DME. It discusses newly published clinical trials on intravitreal pharmacotherapy for DME. The literature was searched using Medline/PubMed and was selected given its relevance for the topic to be discussed.Expert opinion: Our knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of diabetic macular edema has significantly increased. Some of these insights have been successfully transferred into current treatment strategies already including VEGF suppression or anti-inflammatory treatments using steroids. The identification of additional pathophysiological aspects and their relevance as potential treatment targets will be a future challenge in the treatment of DME.

It is known that oxidative stress (OS) damages the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and contributes to the progression of AMD. We review here the potential importance of two OS-related cellular systems in relation to AMD. First, the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2; NRF2)-mediated OS response signalling pathway is important in the prevention of oxidative damage and a failure of this system could be critical in the development of AMD. Second, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) represents a change in the cellular phenotype, which ultimately leads to the fibrosis encountered in RPE, a characteristic of AMD. Many of the pathways triggering EMT are promoted by OS. The possible interconnections between these two signalling routes are discussed here.

Medication treatment is primarily recommended for patients with BPH if their symptom score based on the International Prostate Symptom score (IPSS) is above the moderate level. However, electroacupuncture (EA) and electronic moxibustion (EM), one of the most recent complementary and alternative treatments, are suggested as adjuvant treatments in the improvement of LUTS caused by BPH with respect to the limitations of medication treatments, such as side effects or no improvement in LUTS despite treatment. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of EA and its cotreatment with EM for the improvement of LUTS in patients diagnosed with BPH using an alpha blocker but with moderate symptoms on the basis of IPSS.\nMETHODS/DESIGN:\nThis protocol is a 2-arm parallel-design, randomized, controlled assessor-blinded clinical trial. Seventy-eight patients diagnosed with BPH are randomized to one of the following groups: [EA and its cotreatment with EM + alpha blocker group] and [alpha blocker group]. [EA and its cotreatment with EM + alpha blocker group] continues to use the previously prescribed alpha blocker and visits the study institution 3 times a week for 6 weeks to receive the cotreatment of EA and EM. [Alpha blocker group] continues to use the previously prescribed alpha blocker for 6 weeks. To evaluate the effectiveness of the EA and its cotreatment with EM, the followings are measured: total score of the IPSS, IPSS quality of life assessment, EuroQol-Five dimension, maximum and average urinary flow rate (Qmax and Qave), and prostate size at the baseline, 3rd, 6th, and 12th weeks. The primary effectiveness endpoint measures the average change in the total score of the IPSS at the 6th week. Side effects are recorded at each visit.\nDISCUSSION:\nThe results of this study are expected to provide useful information on the effectiveness and safety of the EA and its cotreatment with EM for patients with BPH with regard to the improvements in LUTS.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION:\nClinical Research Information Service of Republic of Korea (CRIS-KCT0004411), October 31, 2019.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000019678", "title": "Effectiveness and safety of electroacupuncture and its cotreatment with electronic moxibustion in the treatment of patients with moderate benign prostatic hyperplasia using alpha blocker: Study protocol for an assessor-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial.", "references": null}, {"authors": ["Wang JS", "Yang J", "Deng S", "Yu XD", "Bao BH", "Liu RJ", "Li HS"], "publication": "Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Mar;99(12):e19540. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000019540.", "topic": "Prostate Diseases", "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nChronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a common urinary system disease in men.

To improve LUTS, certain complementary therapies have been used with or without doctors' directions. Conventional treatments and complementary therapies tend to be combined unsystematically, depending on patient preference; thus, research for safe and efficient combination therapy is warranted.\nMETHODS:\nTwenty-nine participants were randomly assigned to an integrative group (IG, n = 15) or a conventional group (CG, n = 14). The IG received moxibustion (twice weekly for 4 weeks, at the acupuncture points SP6, LR3, and CV4) and conventional medication for 4 weeks, followed by conventional medication alone for 8 weeks. The CG received conventional medication alone for 12 weeks. The outcome measures were International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), patient's global impression of changes (PGIC), maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax), postvoid residual urine volume (PVR), and frequency-volume chart.\nRESULTS:\nTotal IPSS (IG, -2.4 ± 4.2; CG, 0.9 ± 4.0; P = .039), PGIC-A (IG, 3.5 ± 1.0; CG, 2.2 ± 1.0; P = .001), and PGIC-B (IG, 3.5 ± 0.1; CG, 4.7 ± 0.6; P = .004) were significantly improved in the IG compared with the CG, 4 weeks after baseline.

Bibliometric analyses are quantitative approaches examining the impact of academic literature. We used the following search terms and Boolean logic \"(\"benign prostat*\") AND (hyperplasia OR enlarg*)\" and characterized the 100 most-cited BPH articles through 2018 including citations, journal, author, year, and country.\nRESULTS:\nThe top 100 BPH articles were published between 1978 and 2012. Citations ranged from 153 to 2171 across 27 different journals, including 10 urology-specific journals. The Journal of Urology was the most published journal (n = 25), followed by European Urology (n = 17), and Urology (n = 15). In general, the oldest 10 articles focused on BPH etiology/pathogenesis, while the newest 10 focused on treatment. The 1990's was the most productive decade with nearly half of the top 100 articles (n = 44). Twenty-six different countries contributed to the top 100 articles, with the US (n = 74), Italy (n = 19), and Canada (n = 12) being the most common.\nCONCLUSION:\nThis study represents the first bibliometric analysis of the leading BPH articles impacting the academic literature. The focus has evolved from BPH pathogenesis to treatment, perhaps reflecting a shift in research funding and capacity.

Ejaculatory hood sparing vaporization was performed with preservation of the paracollicular and supracollicular tissue proximal to the verumontanum in 25 patients. Patients were assessed at baseline, and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively using the Ej-MSHQ (Ejaculatory Domain of Male Sexual Health Questionnaire) and the IIEF-15 (International Index of Erectile Function-15). The I-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Score), uroflowmetry and post-void residual urine volume were reported at each followup visit. A standard urodynamic study was performed at 6 months.\nRESULTS:\nAntegrade ejaculation was reported in 85% and 31.6% of patients after hood sparing and standard prostate vaporization, respectively (p=0.001). A significant reduction in the EJ-MSHQ score was reported after standard vaporization at 6 and 12 months (each p <0.001) with no significant difference after hood sparing vaporization (p=0.18 and 0.078, respectively). The median EJ-MSHQ score was 28.5 (range 1 to 33) and 27 (range 1 to 33) for hood sparing vaporization, and 9.5 (range 1 to 35) and 9 (range 0 to 33) for standard vaporization at 6 (p=0.005) and 12 months (p <0.001), respectively. Each group showed a decline in the mean total IIEF-15 score at 1 year but it was statistically significant only after standard vaporization (p=0.001). All urinary outcome measures revealed comparable significant improvement at all followups. Postoperative urodynamic assessment demonstrated a significant comparable decrease in the Bladder Outlet Obstruction Index from a median of 64 (range 21 to 207) to 23.5 (range 10 to 53) after hood sparing vaporization (p=0.005) and from 87 (range 38 to 186) to 19.5 (range 7 to 51) after standard vaporization (p=0.001). At 1 year the overall re-treatment rate was comparable in the 2 groups (p=0.26).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nIn well informed, sexually interested patients ejaculatory hood sparing GreenLight prostate photoselective vaporization is feasible and effective treatment of small to moderate sized benign prostatic hyperplasia with a superior sexual function related outcome.

The primary outcomes were the maximal flow rate (Qmax) and international prostate symptoms score (IPSS) at 12 months after surgical treatment. Secondary outcomes were Qmax and IPSS values at 6, 24, and 36 months after surgical treatment; perioperative parameters; and surgical complications.\nDATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS:\nTwo independent reviewers extracted the study data and performed quality assessments using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. The effect sizes were summarised using weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes and odds ratios for binary outcomes. Frequentist approach to the network meta-analysis was used to estimate comparative effects and safety. Ranking probabilities of each treatment were also calculated.\nRESULTS:\n109 trials with a total of 13 676 participants were identified. Nine surgical treatments were evaluated. Enucleation achieved better Qmax and IPSS values than resection and vapourisation methods at six and 12 months after surgical treatment, and the difference maintained up to 24 and 36 months after surgical treatment. For Qmax at 12 months after surgical treatment, the best three methods compared with monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) were bipolar enucleation (mean difference 2.42 mL/s (95% confidence interval 1.11 to 3.73)), diode laser enucleation (1.86 (-0.17 to 3.88)), and holmium laser enucleation (1.07 (0.07 to 2.08)). The worst performing method was diode laser vapourisation (-1.90 (-5.07 to 1.27)). The results of IPSS at 12 months after treatment were similar to Qmax at 12 months after treatment. The best three methods, versus monopolar TURP, were diode laser enucleation (mean difference -1.00 (-2.41 to 0.40)), bipolar enucleation (0.87 (-1.80 to 0.07)), and holmium laser enucleation (-0.84 (-1.51 to 0.58)). The worst performing method was diode laser vapourisation (1.30 (-1.16 to 3.76)). Eight new methods were better at controlling bleeding than monopolar TURP, resulting in a shorter catheterisation duration, reduced postoperative haemoglobin declination, fewer clot retention events, and lower blood transfusion rate. However, short term transient urinary incontinence might still be a concern for enucleation methods, compared with resection methods (odds ratio 1.92, 1.39 to 2.65). No substantial inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence was detected in primary or secondary outcomes.\nCONCLUSION:\nEight new endoscopic surgical methods for benign prostatic hyperplasia appeared to be superior in safety compared with monopolar TURP. Among these new treatments, enucleation methods showed better Qmax and IPSS values than vapourisation and resection methods.\nSTUDY REGISTRATION:\nCRD42018099583.\nPublished by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

The objective of the present study was to review the available literature and describe the cases of prosthetic joint infection caused by Candida species in patients of the Institute of Orthopedics and Trauma of the University of São Paulo Faculty of Medicine Clinics Hospital (IOT-HCFMUSP) between 2007 and 2014.\nPATIENT CONCERNS:\nEleven patients were diagnosed with prosthetic joint infection due to Candida with mean age of 65 years. The most frequent comorbidities were heart disease and diabetes mellitus, and the main personal antecedent was previous bacterial infection in the prosthetic joint. At least one risk factor for fungal infection was present in 73% of the patients. There was no difference between the prevalence of infections caused by Candida albicans and non-albicans Candida species, and there was bacterial co-infection in 55% of the cases.\nDIAGNOSIS:\nFor building up the case series, patients with cultures of bone and joint specimens that were positive for Candida species and had a clinical diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection were included in the case series.\nINTERVENTIONS:\nSurgical debridement with removal of the prosthesis was the most frequently used surgical approach (45%). All patients were treated with monotherapy, and the most frequently used antifungal agent was fluconazole. The total duration of antifungal therapy was 6 months in 73% of the cases.\nOUTCOMES:\nAfter the initial management, 73% of the patients achieved clinical remission.\nCONCLUSION:\nThe most indicated initial management was debridement with removal of the prosthesis, and the most used treatment regimen was fluconazole monotherapy.

Whether the short-term and long-term effectiveness for relieving pain and improving physical function differ between these two therapies is uncertain.\nMETHODS:\nWe conducted a randomized trial to compare physical therapy with glucocorticoid injection in the primary care setting in the U.S. Military Health System. Patients with osteoarthritis in one or both knees were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a glucocorticoid injection or to undergo physical therapy. The primary outcome was the total score on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) at 1 year (scores range from 0 to 240, with higher scores indicating worse pain, function, and stiffness). The secondary outcomes were the time needed to complete the Alternate Step Test, the time needed to complete the Timed Up and Go test, and the score on the Global Rating of Change scale, all assessed at 1 year.\nRESULTS:\nWe enrolled 156 patients with a mean age of 56 years; 78 patients were assigned to each group. Baseline characteristics, including severity of pain and level of disability, were similar in the two groups. The mean (±SD) baseline WOMAC scores were 108.8±47.1 in the glucocorticoid injection group and 107.1±42.4 in the physical therapy group. At 1 year, the mean scores were 55.8±53.8 and 37.0±30.7, respectively (mean between-group difference, 18.8 points; 95% confidence interval, 5.0 to 32.6), a finding favoring physical therapy. Changes in secondary outcomes were in the same direction as those of the primary outcome. One patient fainted while receiving a glucocorticoid injection.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nPatients with osteoarthritis of the knee who underwent physical therapy had less pain and functional disability at 1 year than patients who received an intraarticular glucocorticoid injection.

Mean follow-up time was 53 months (24 to 112). All TKAs in stiff knees were performed with a 2 mm increased flexion gap. Data were compared to a matched control group of 98 TKAs (86 patients) with a mean follow-up of 43 months (24 to 89). Knees in the control group had a preoperative ROM of at least 100° and balanced flexion and extension gaps. In all stiff and non-stiff knees posterior stabilized (PS) TKAs with patellar resurfacing in combination with adequate soft tissue balancing were used.\nRESULTS:\nOverall mean ROM in stiff knees increased preoperatively from 67° (0° to 80°) to 114° postoperatively (65° to 135°) (p < 0.001). Mean knee flexion improved from 82° (0° to 110°) to 115° (65° to 135°) and mean flexion contracture decreased from 14° (0° to 50°) to 1° (0° to 10°) (p < 0.001).

While the improvement in ROM was greater, the absolute postoperative ROM was less than in matched non-stiff knees. PS TKA with patellar resurfacing and a 2 mm increased flexion gap, in combination with adequate soft tissue balancing, provides excellent ROM and knee function when stiffness of the knee had been present preoperatively.

The aim of this study was to evaluate mid-term outcomes of an existing implant trial cohort to document changing patient function over time following total knee arthroplasty using longitudinal analytical techniques and to determine whether implant design chosen at time of surgery influenced these outcomes.\nMETHODS:\nA mid-term follow-up of the remaining 125 patients from a randomized cohort of total knee arthroplasty patients (initially comprising 212 recruited patients), comparing modern (Triathlon) and traditional (Kinemax) prostheses was undertaken. Functional outcomes were assessed with the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), knee range of movement, pain numerical rating scales, lower limb power output, timed functional assessment battery, and satisfaction survey. Data were linked to earlier assessment timepoints, and analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) mixed models, incorporating longitudinal change over all assessment timepoints.\nRESULTS:\nThe mean follow-up of the 125 patients was 8.12 years (7.3 to 9.4). There was a reduction in all assessment parameters relative to earlier assessments. Longitudinal models highlight changes over time in all parameters and demonstrate large effect sizes. Significant between-group differences were seen in measures of knee flexion (medium-effect size), lower limb power output (large-effect size), and report of worst daily pain experienced (large-effect size) favouring the Triathlon group. No longitudinal between-group differences were observed in mean OKS, average daily pain report, or timed performance test. Satisfaction with outcome in surviving patients at eight years was 90.5% (57/63) in the Triathlon group and 82.8% (48/58) in the Kinemax group, with no statistical difference between groups (p = 0.321).\nCONCLUSION:\nAt a mean 8.12 years, this mid-term follow-up of a randomized controlled trial cohort highlights a general reduction in measures of patient function with patient age and follow-up duration, and a comparative preservation of function based on implant received at time of surgery.

Patients completed patient-reported outcomes including EuroQol five-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D) and 6-Item Short-Form Health Survey questionnaire (SF-6D) before the procedure. The scores were completed again after six weeks, three, six, and nine months, and again after one- and two-year post-surgery and yearly henceforth. Time-weighted outcome measures were constructed. Cost data were obtained from clinical registrations and patient-reported questionnaires. Incremental gain in health outcomes (quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)) and incremental costs were compared for the two groups of patients. Net monetary benefit was calculated assuming a threshold value of €10,000, €35,000, and €50,000 per QALY and used to test the statistical uncertainty and central assumptions about outcomes and costs.\nRESULTS:\nThe PFA group had an incremental 12 month EQ-5D gain of 0.056 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.10) and an incremental 12 month cost of minus €328 (95% CI 836 to 180). PFA therefore dominates TKA by providing better and cheaper outcomes than TKA. The net monetary benefit of PFA was €887 (95% CI 324 to 1450) with the €10,000 threshold, and it was consistently positive when different measures of outcomes and different cost assumptions were used.\nCONCLUSION:\nThis study provides robust evidence that PFA from a one-year hospital management perspective is cheaper and provides better outcomes than TKA when applied to patients with isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis and performed by experienced knee surgeons.

KOA can lead to disability and is often associated with cardiovascular disease, poor quality of life, and mortality. The most common treatment for KOA is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug administration. However, the analgesic effect is limited and often accompanied by multiple side effects. Hence, many KOA patients opt for complementary and alternative medicine. Acupuncture is one of the most popular complementary treatments with great analgesic effect and minimal side effect. Electroacupuncture (EA) and laser acupuncture (LA) have been known to reduce pain in KOA patients. However, to date, no study has assessed the benefits of combining these two therapies.\nMETHODS:\nFifty participants diagnosed with KOA, aged 50 years or older, and with consistent knee pain for more than 3 months were recruited and randomly assigned to the treatment group (EA plus LA) or control group (EA plus sham LA without laser output).

In recent years, people are more and more interested in the use of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in the treatment of KOA, such as kidney-tonifying and blood-activating medicinal herbs (KTBAMs) in the treatment of KOA. Many studies have confirmed that KTBAMs are effective in the treatment of KOA. However, it is still unknown whether KTBAMs and NSAIDs are more effective in the treatment of KOA. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of KTBAMs and NSAIDs in the treatment of KOA.\nMETHODS:\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) from online databases including PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, Wanfang Data, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database that compared the efficacy of KTBAMs and NSAIDs in the treatment of KOA were retrieved. The main outcomes included the evaluation of functional outcomes, pain and adverse effects. The Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) tool was used to assess methodological quality.\nRESULTS:\nThe literature will provide a high-quality analysis of the current evidence supporting KTBAMs for KOA based on various comprehensive assessments including the total effective rate, visual analog scale scores, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Lequence scores, Knee Society Scale (KSS) scores, and adverse effects.\nCONCLUSION:\nThis proposed systematic review will provide up-to-date evidence to assess the effect of KTBAMs in the treatment for patients with KOA.

This study aims to analyze which classification system correlates best with FTCL and to assess their reliability.\nMETHODS:\nA prospective study of 300 consecutive patients undergoing unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for OA (mean age 69 years (44 to 91; standard deviation (SD) 9.5), 178 (59%) female). Two blinded examiners independently graded preoperative radiographs using five common systems: Kellgren-Lawrence (KL); International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC); Fairbank; Brandt; and Ahlbäck. Interobserver agreement was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Intraoperatively, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) status and the presence of FTCL in 16 regions of interest were recorded. Radiological classification and FTCL were correlated using the Spearman correlation coefficient.\nRESULTS:\nKnees had a mean of 6.8 regions of FTCL (SD 3.1), most common medially. The commonest patterns of FTCL were medial ± patellofemoral (143/300, 48%) and tricompartmental (89/300, 30%). ACL status was associated with pattern of FTCL (p = 0.023). All radiological classification systems demonstrated moderate ICC, but this was highest for the IKDC: whole knee 0.68 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.74); medial compartment 0.84 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.87); and lateral compartment 0.79 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.83). Correlation with actual FTCL was strongest for Ahlbäck (Spearman rho 0.27 to 0.39) and KL (0.30 to 0.33) systems, although all systems demonstrated medium correlation. The Ahlbäck score was the most discriminating in severe knee OA. Osteophyte presence in the medial compartment had high positive predictive value (PPV) for FTCL, but not in the lateral compartment.\nCONCLUSION:\nThe Ahlbäck and KL systems had the highest correlation with confirmed cartilage loss at TKA. However, the IKDC system displayed the best interobserver reliability, with favourable correlation with FTCL in medial and lateral compartments, although it was less discriminating in more severe disease.

There is, however, little available information about the use of patient-specific planning (PSP) tools for this operation. It is not known how these tools alter the decision-making patterns of shoulder surgeons. The aim of this study was to investigate whether PSP, when compared with the use of plain radiographs or select static CT images, influences the understanding of glenoid pathology and surgical planning.\nMETHODS:\nA case-based survey presented surgeons with a patient's history, physical examination, and, sequentially, radiographs, select static CT images, and PSP with a 3D imaging program. For each imaging modality, the surgeons were asked to identify the Walch classification of the glenoid and to propose the surgical treatment. The participating surgeons were grouped according to the annual volume of shoulder arthroplasties that they undertook, and responses were compared with the recommendations of two experts.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 59 surgeons completed the survey. For all surgeons, the use of the PSP significantly increased agreement with the experts in glenoid classification (x2 = 8.54; p = 0.014) and surgical planning (x2 = 37.91; p < 0.001). The additional information provided by the PSP also showed a significantly higher impact on surgical decision-making for surgeons who undertake fewer than ten shoulder arthroplasties annually (p = 0.017).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThe information provided by PSP has the greatest impact on the surgical decision-making of low volume surgeons (those who perform fewer than ten shoulder arthroplasties annually), and PSP brings all surgeons in to closer agreement with the recommendations of experts for glenoid classification and surgical planning.
