[{"references": null, "title": "Reproductive Urologist and Gynecologist Involvement in Postvasectomy Sperm Retrieval Procedures at American Fertility Clinics.", "abstract": "Abstract\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo evaluate reproductive urologist and reproductive endocrinologist practice patterns for postvasectomy surgical sperm retrieval at American private practice fertility clinics.\nMETHODS:\nPrivate practice American fertility clinics were contacted by telephone and administered a telephone survey. In states with multiple large cities, several clinics in different cities were surveyed. Our primary endpoint was to determine what specialty of physician (urologist or reproductive endocrinology gynecologist) performed sperm retrieval procedures. Secondarily, we inquired about the location that these procedures were performed (urology vs gynecology clinic), type of anesthesia used, and cash cost for the procedure.\nRESULTS:\nTwo hundred and twenty-five infertility clinics were contacted (per state range 2-10). 90.2% (203/225) of clinics responded to our queries. Zero clinics had an on-site urologist. An on-staff gynecologist with reproductive endocrinology training performed postvasectomy sperm retrievals in 9.4% (19/203) of clinics. A urologist \"partnered\" with the infertility clinic performed sperm retrievals at the fertility clinic in 11.8% (24/203) of clinics. 18.7% (38/203) did not offer sperm retrieval on-site, but did have a referral pattern established with a local urologist. Among reproductive endocrinologist performing sperm retrievals, intravenous anesthesia was used in 76.9% (10/13) of clinics. The quoted costs for surgical sperm retrieval performed by a reproductive endocrinologist ranged from $1000 to 10,000.\nCONCLUSION:\nSurgical sperm retrieval postvasectomy performed by an on-site reproductive endocrinologist was offered by 9.4% of contacted fertility clinics. The majority (76.9%) of these cases were routinely performed under intravenous anesthesia. Costs for reproductive endocrinologist performed sperm retrievals varied considerably. The reasons for, and safety of reproductive endocrinologists performing these procedures remains to be determined.\nCopyright © 2019.", "publication": "Urology. 2019 Nov;133:116-120. doi: 10.1016/j.urology.2019.08.019.

We sought to determine if routine prescribing of opioids is necessary for pain control after vasectomy, and if an association exists with persistent use.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\nWe retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients who underwent vasectomy in clinic between April 2017 and March 2018. Patients were stratified into 2 groups, including those initially prescribed opioids and those not receiving opioid prescriptions at the time of vasectomy. The initial pain medication regimen depended on the standard prescription practice of each provider. Encounters with a medical provider for scrotal pain within 30 days, subsequent opioid prescriptions and new persistent opioid prescriptions between 90 and 180 days were compared between the 2 groups using the Fisher exact test.\nRESULTS:\nBetween April 2017 and March 2018 a total of 228 patients underwent clinic vasectomy as performed by 8 urologists. At the time of vasectomy 102 patients received opioid prescriptions and 126 received no opioid prescriptions. There was no statistically significant difference between the opioid and nonopioid groups in encounters for scrotal pain (12.7% vs 18.4%, p = 0.279). The incidence of new persistent opioid use was 7.8% in the opioid cohort compared to 1.5% in the nonopioid cohort (p = 0.046).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nOpioids, which do not appear to be necessary in men who undergo vasectomy, were associated with persistent use in 7.8% of patients at 3 to 6 months.

Since vasectomy is a common and effective form of contraception, these implications are significant. Therefore, we sought to test this association in a large observational cohort.\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo evaluate the potential association between prior vasectomy and the risk of developing prostate cancer.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\nWe evaluated the relationship between vasectomy and prostate cancer in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. Of the 111,914 men, prostate cancer was identified in 13,885 men and vasectomies were performed in 48,657. We used multivariate analysis to examine the relationship between prostate cancer and vasectomy. We also performed propensity score-adjusted and propensity score-matched analysis.\nRESULTS:\nMen utilizing vasectomy were more likely to be ever married, fathers, educated, white, and screened for prostate cancer. During 4,251,863 person-years of follow-up, there was a small association between vasectomy and incident prostate cancer with a hazard ratio of 1.05 (95% CI, 1.01-1.11). However, no significant association was found when looking separately at prostate cancer by grade or stage. Conclusions were similar when using propensity adjustment and matching. Importantly, a significant interaction between vasectomy and PSA screening was identified.\nDISCUSSION:\nEstimates of the association between vasectomy and prostate cancer are sensitive to analytic method underscoring the tenuous nature of the connection. Given the differences between men who do and do not utilize vasectomy, selection bias appears likely to explain any identified association between vasectomy and prostate cancer.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nWith over 20 years of follow-up, no convincing relationship between vasectomy and prostate cancer of any grade was identified.\n© 2019 American Society of Andrology and European Academy of Andrology.", "publication": "Andrology. 2019 Mar;7(2):178-183. doi: 10.1111/andr.12570.

During the procedure, a total of 125 fresh vas deferens samples were obtained and divided into four groups as follows: Group 1: ligation (n = 22), Group 2; ligation and electrocauterization (n = 18), Group 3; 5 mm LSVS (n = 44), Group 4; 10 mm LSVS (n = 41).

Pain was documented using the numerical rating scale (NRS). Spermatic cord block (SCB) was performed on all patients, and success was defined as NRS score ≤1 for >4 h. All patients had failed medical therapy prior to MDSC. All previous procedures for PVPS had been performed elsewhere. Surgical success was defined as a postoperative NRS score of ≤1.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 27 patients with 28 scrotal units underwent MDSC for PVPS. The median (1st quartile; 3rd quartile) follow-up was 10 (2; 16.5) months. The median (range) duration of pain prior to surgery was 57 (8-468) months. Pain was bilateral in 14 (52%), left-sided in eight (30%) and right-sided in five patients (19%). Data on SCB were available for 23 patients, with a success rate of 96%.

The survey questions and 3 clinical scenarios were designed based on the 2012 AUA vasectomy guidelines. Results of the survey were compiled between urologists and nonurologists and then compared with the guideline recommendations.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 23 FMPs and 6 urologists responded. Fewer prevasectomy counseling topics were discussed by FMPs compared with urologists. A variety of vasectomy techniques were used among FMPs. Vas deferens segments were more likely to be sent for histology by FMPs than urologists (65% vs 17%, P = .02). FMPs were more likely to send postvasectomy semen analyses earlier than urologists (P = .02) and more likely to send multiple postvasectomy semen analyses (P = .006) before forgoing alternative contraceptive methods. Regarding the clinical scenario questions, FMPs were more likely to answer discordantly from guideline recommendations compared with urologists.\nCONCLUSION:\nSignificant vasectomy practice pattern heterogeneity still exists among nonurologists surveyed within our institution. The 2012 AUA vasectomy guidelines have yet to be broadly implemented within nonurology practices. Further studies are warranted to investigate national trends in nonurologist vasectomy practice patterns and determine how the guidelines can be better implemented in nonurologic practices.\nCopyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

PVPS is defined as at least 3 months of chronic or intermittent scrotal content pain after a vasectomy procedure once other etiologies for the pain have been ruled out.\nAIM:\nTo systematically review the current literature on the effectiveness of micro-denervation of the spermatic cord (MDSC) for PVPS.\nMETHODS:\nA systematic literature search using PubMed, Scopus, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases for all reports pertaining to PVPS using the Medical Subject Heading terms post vasectomy pain syndrome and micro-denervation of spermatic cord through February 2017.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:\nScrotal content pain after MDSC for PVPS.\nRESULTS:\nThere were nine retrospective studies evaluating MDSC for chronic testicular pain. After omitting repeated series, there were 213 patients who underwent MDSC for chronic orchialgia. Only one study specifically reviewed the outcomes of patients who underwent MDSC for PVPS. In this study, 17 patients underwent MSDC for PVPS, with 13 (76.5%) reporting complete relief of pain at their first follow-up visit. The other four patients had significant improvement in pain and were satisfied with the results. Long-term follow-up data were not available for this study.\nCONCLUSION:\nMDSC remains a valuable approach with high success rates and should be considered for PVPS that is refractory to medical therapy. MDSC appears to have the most success for patients who experience a temporary relief from a cord block and can significantly improve the patient's quality of life and ability to return to daily activities.

Between February 2012 and February 2015, three waves of in-depth interviews were conducted with program administrators at 54 family planning organizations in Texas. Participants described their organization's vasectomy service model and factors that influenced how frequently vasectomy was provided. Interview transcripts were coded and analyzed using a theme-based approach. Service models and barriers to providing vasectomy were compared by organization type (e.g., women's health center, public health clinic) and receipt of Title X funding. Two thirds of organizations did not offer vasectomy on-site or pay for referrals with family planning funding; nine organizations frequently provided vasectomy. Organizations did not widely offer vasectomy because they could not find providers that would accept the low reimbursement for the procedure or because they lacked funding for men's reproductive health care. Respondents often did not perceive men's reproductive health care as a service priority and commented that men, especially Latinos, had limited interest in vasectomy. Although organizations of all types reported barriers, women's health centers and Title X-funded organizations more frequently offered vasectomy by conducting tailored outreach to men and vasectomy providers.

We conducted an extensive review of the vasectomy research literature and programmatic reports, published between April 2005 and April 2015, to synthesize barriers and facilitators to vasectomy adoption. Of the more than 230 documents initially retrieved in our search, we ultimately included 75 documents in our review and synthesized the findings according to the Supply-Enabling Environment-Demand (SEED) Programming Model. Regarding promoting demand for vasectomy services, we found there was a general lack of awareness about the method among both men and women, which often fueled erroneous assumptions about how vasectomy affects men. Several types of programmatic activities directly addressed knowledge gaps and negative misperceptions, including community-based and mass media communications, employer-based promotion, and group counseling. For supply of services, the lack of or inaccurate knowledge about vasectomy was also prevalent among providers, particularly among community-based health workers. Programmatic activities to improve service delivery included the use of evidence-based vasectomy techniques such as no-scalpel vasectomy, whole-site trainings, task shifting, cascade training, and mobile outreach. Finally, programmatic approaches to building a more enabling environment included engagement of governments and other community and religious leaders as well as campaigns with gender transformative messaging that countered common myths and encouraged men's positive engagement in family planning and reproductive health. In summary, a successful vasectomy program is comprised of the mutually reinforcing components of continual demand for services and access to and supply of well-trained providers. In addition, there is an underlying need for enabling policies within the cultural and gender environments that extend beyond vasectomy and include men not just as default partners of female family planning clients but as equal beneficiaries of family planning and reproductive health programs in their own right. Accelerating progress toward meaningful integration of vasectomy into a comprehensive contraceptive method mix is only possible when political and financial will are aligned and support the logistical and promotional activities of a male reproductive health agenda.\n© Shattuck et al.", "publication": "Glob Health Sci Pract. 2016 Dec 28;4(4):647-660. doi: 10.9745/GHSP-D-16-00235.

We utilized a logistic regression model to determine if vasectomy utilization varies based on offspring sex ratio while accounting for known factors that impact vasectomy utilization.\nRESULTS:\nOf these men, 30,927 (30.8%) underwent vasectomy. Marital status, race, age, education level, region or state, and number of offspring were all significantly correlated with vasectomy utilization (P < .01). The sex ratio for vasectomized fathers (51.3%) was significantly higher than for fathers who had not undergone vasectomy (50.7%, P < .01). This difference remained even after we stratified by the total number of offspring: vasectomized men with 4 or more children had a sex ratio of 947 girls per 1000 boys, whereas the no vasectomy group had a sex ratio of 983 girls per 1000 boys (P < .01). For men with at least 2 children, each additional son increased the likelihood of vasectomy by 4% (P < .01), whereas each additional daughter led to a 2% decrease in vasectomy utilization (P = .03).\nCONCLUSION:\nVasectomized fathers have a higher proportion of sons compared with non-vasectomized fathers, suggesting that offspring sex ratio is associated with a man's decision to undergo vasectomy. Further research is indicated to understand how offspring sex ratio impacts a man's contraceptive decisions.\nCopyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Vasectomy reversal procedures were identified by 3 current procedure terminology (CPT) codes: 55400 (vasovasostomy), 54900 (epididymovasostomy, unilateral), and 54901 (epididymovasostomy, bilateral). Demographic data were obtained and reviewed. Multivariate analysis determined the factors influencing the performance of surgical approach.\nRESULTS:\nThere were 5167 urologists who submitted case logs for 2008-2014, and 9.4% (486) had performed at least one vasectomy reversal procedure. General urologists accounted for the highest overall volume of vasectomy reversal procedures. Andrology-trained urologists performed a higher volume of vasovasostomy per surgeon, and bilateral epididymovasostomy constituted a greater portion of their E-V practice. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that being in recertification years, being younger in age, practicing in the South Central, Southeast, and Western regions, and practicing in the largest and smallest practice areas were associated with being more likely to perform a vasectomy reversal procedure.\nCONCLUSION:\nMicrosurgical vasectomy reversals are putatively considered technically challenging and reserved for fellowship-trained urologists, and the majority of vasectomy reversal surgeries were performed by general urologists. Given the known association between microsurgical technique and improved outcomes, greater emphasis should be placed on microsurgical training during urology residency.\nCopyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.
