[{"references": null, "title": "Reproductive Urologist and Gynecologist Involvement in Postvasectomy Sperm Retrieval Procedures at American Fertility Clinics.", "abstract": "Abstract\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo evaluate reproductive urologist and reproductive endocrinologist practice patterns for postvasectomy surgical sperm retrieval at American private practice fertility clinics.\nMETHODS:\nPrivate practice American fertility clinics were contacted by telephone and administered a telephone survey. In states with multiple large cities, several clinics in different cities were surveyed. Our primary endpoint was to determine what specialty of physician (urologist or reproductive endocrinology gynecologist) performed sperm retrieval procedures. Secondarily, we inquired about the location that these procedures were performed (urology vs gynecology clinic), type of anesthesia used, and cash cost for the procedure.\nRESULTS:\nTwo hundred and twenty-five infertility clinics were contacted (per state range 2-10). 90.2% (203/225) of clinics responded to our queries. Zero clinics had an on-site urologist. An on-staff gynecologist with reproductive endocrinology training performed postvasectomy sperm retrievals in 9.4% (19/203) of clinics. A urologist \"partnered\" with the infertility clinic performed sperm retrievals at the fertility clinic in 11.8% (24/203) of clinics. 18.7% (38/203) did not offer sperm retrieval on-site, but did have a referral pattern established with a local urologist. Among reproductive endocrinologist performing sperm retrievals, intravenous anesthesia was used in 76.9% (10/13) of clinics. The quoted costs for surgical sperm retrieval performed by a reproductive endocrinologist ranged from $1000 to 10,000.\nCONCLUSION:\nSurgical sperm retrieval postvasectomy performed by an on-site reproductive endocrinologist was offered by 9.4% of contacted fertility clinics. The majority (76.9%) of these cases were routinely performed under intravenous anesthesia. Costs for reproductive endocrinologist performed sperm retrievals varied considerably. The reasons for, and safety of reproductive endocrinologists performing these procedures remains to be determined.\nCopyright © 2019.", "publication": "Urology. 2019 Nov;133:116-120. doi: 10.1016/j.urology.2019.08.019.

We sought to determine if routine prescribing of opioids is necessary for pain control after vasectomy, and if an association exists with persistent use.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\nWe retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients who underwent vasectomy in clinic between April 2017 and March 2018. Patients were stratified into 2 groups, including those initially prescribed opioids and those not receiving opioid prescriptions at the time of vasectomy. The initial pain medication regimen depended on the standard prescription practice of each provider. Encounters with a medical provider for scrotal pain within 30 days, subsequent opioid prescriptions and new persistent opioid prescriptions between 90 and 180 days were compared between the 2 groups using the Fisher exact test.\nRESULTS:\nBetween April 2017 and March 2018 a total of 228 patients underwent clinic vasectomy as performed by 8 urologists. At the time of vasectomy 102 patients received opioid prescriptions and 126 received no opioid prescriptions. There was no statistically significant difference between the opioid and nonopioid groups in encounters for scrotal pain (12.7% vs 18.4%, p = 0.279). The incidence of new persistent opioid use was 7.8% in the opioid cohort compared to 1.5% in the nonopioid cohort (p = 0.046).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nOpioids, which do not appear to be necessary in men who undergo vasectomy, were associated with persistent use in 7.8% of patients at 3 to 6 months.

Since vasectomy is a common and effective form of contraception, these implications are significant. Therefore, we sought to test this association in a large observational cohort.\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo evaluate the potential association between prior vasectomy and the risk of developing prostate cancer.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\nWe evaluated the relationship between vasectomy and prostate cancer in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. Of the 111,914 men, prostate cancer was identified in 13,885 men and vasectomies were performed in 48,657. We used multivariate analysis to examine the relationship between prostate cancer and vasectomy. We also performed propensity score-adjusted and propensity score-matched analysis.\nRESULTS:\nMen utilizing vasectomy were more likely to be ever married, fathers, educated, white, and screened for prostate cancer. During 4,251,863 person-years of follow-up, there was a small association between vasectomy and incident prostate cancer with a hazard ratio of 1.05 (95% CI, 1.01-1.11). However, no significant association was found when looking separately at prostate cancer by grade or stage. Conclusions were similar when using propensity adjustment and matching. Importantly, a significant interaction between vasectomy and PSA screening was identified.\nDISCUSSION:\nEstimates of the association between vasectomy and prostate cancer are sensitive to analytic method underscoring the tenuous nature of the connection. Given the differences between men who do and do not utilize vasectomy, selection bias appears likely to explain any identified association between vasectomy and prostate cancer.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nWith over 20 years of follow-up, no convincing relationship between vasectomy and prostate cancer of any grade was identified.\n© 2019 American Society of Andrology and European Academy of Andrology.", "publication": "Andrology. 2019 Mar;7(2):178-183. doi: 10.1111/andr.12570.

During the procedure, a total of 125 fresh vas deferens samples were obtained and divided into four groups as follows: Group 1: ligation (n = 22), Group 2; ligation and electrocauterization (n = 18), Group 3; 5 mm LSVS (n = 44), Group 4; 10 mm LSVS (n = 41).

Pain was documented using the numerical rating scale (NRS). Spermatic cord block (SCB) was performed on all patients, and success was defined as NRS score ≤1 for >4 h. All patients had failed medical therapy prior to MDSC. All previous procedures for PVPS had been performed elsewhere. Surgical success was defined as a postoperative NRS score of ≤1.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 27 patients with 28 scrotal units underwent MDSC for PVPS. The median (1st quartile; 3rd quartile) follow-up was 10 (2; 16.5) months. The median (range) duration of pain prior to surgery was 57 (8-468) months. Pain was bilateral in 14 (52%), left-sided in eight (30%) and right-sided in five patients (19%). Data on SCB were available for 23 patients, with a success rate of 96%.

The survey questions and 3 clinical scenarios were designed based on the 2012 AUA vasectomy guidelines. Results of the survey were compiled between urologists and nonurologists and then compared with the guideline recommendations.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 23 FMPs and 6 urologists responded. Fewer prevasectomy counseling topics were discussed by FMPs compared with urologists. A variety of vasectomy techniques were used among FMPs. Vas deferens segments were more likely to be sent for histology by FMPs than urologists (65% vs 17%, P = .02). FMPs were more likely to send postvasectomy semen analyses earlier than urologists (P = .02) and more likely to send multiple postvasectomy semen analyses (P = .006) before forgoing alternative contraceptive methods. Regarding the clinical scenario questions, FMPs were more likely to answer discordantly from guideline recommendations compared with urologists.\nCONCLUSION:\nSignificant vasectomy practice pattern heterogeneity still exists among nonurologists surveyed within our institution. The 2012 AUA vasectomy guidelines have yet to be broadly implemented within nonurology practices. Further studies are warranted to investigate national trends in nonurologist vasectomy practice patterns and determine how the guidelines can be better implemented in nonurologic practices.\nCopyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

PVPS is defined as at least 3 months of chronic or intermittent scrotal content pain after a vasectomy procedure once other etiologies for the pain have been ruled out.\nAIM:\nTo systematically review the current literature on the effectiveness of micro-denervation of the spermatic cord (MDSC) for PVPS.\nMETHODS:\nA systematic literature search using PubMed, Scopus, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases for all reports pertaining to PVPS using the Medical Subject Heading terms post vasectomy pain syndrome and micro-denervation of spermatic cord through February 2017.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:\nScrotal content pain after MDSC for PVPS.\nRESULTS:\nThere were nine retrospective studies evaluating MDSC for chronic testicular pain. After omitting repeated series, there were 213 patients who underwent MDSC for chronic orchialgia. Only one study specifically reviewed the outcomes of patients who underwent MDSC for PVPS. In this study, 17 patients underwent MSDC for PVPS, with 13 (76.5%) reporting complete relief of pain at their first follow-up visit. The other four patients had significant improvement in pain and were satisfied with the results. Long-term follow-up data were not available for this study.\nCONCLUSION:\nMDSC remains a valuable approach with high success rates and should be considered for PVPS that is refractory to medical therapy. MDSC appears to have the most success for patients who experience a temporary relief from a cord block and can significantly improve the patient's quality of life and ability to return to daily activities.

Between February 2012 and February 2015, three waves of in-depth interviews were conducted with program administrators at 54 family planning organizations in Texas. Participants described their organization's vasectomy service model and factors that influenced how frequently vasectomy was provided. Interview transcripts were coded and analyzed using a theme-based approach. Service models and barriers to providing vasectomy were compared by organization type (e.g., women's health center, public health clinic) and receipt of Title X funding. Two thirds of organizations did not offer vasectomy on-site or pay for referrals with family planning funding; nine organizations frequently provided vasectomy. Organizations did not widely offer vasectomy because they could not find providers that would accept the low reimbursement for the procedure or because they lacked funding for men's reproductive health care. Respondents often did not perceive men's reproductive health care as a service priority and commented that men, especially Latinos, had limited interest in vasectomy. Although organizations of all types reported barriers, women's health centers and Title X-funded organizations more frequently offered vasectomy by conducting tailored outreach to men and vasectomy providers.

We conducted an extensive review of the vasectomy research literature and programmatic reports, published between April 2005 and April 2015, to synthesize barriers and facilitators to vasectomy adoption. Of the more than 230 documents initially retrieved in our search, we ultimately included 75 documents in our review and synthesized the findings according to the Supply-Enabling Environment-Demand (SEED) Programming Model. Regarding promoting demand for vasectomy services, we found there was a general lack of awareness about the method among both men and women, which often fueled erroneous assumptions about how vasectomy affects men. Several types of programmatic activities directly addressed knowledge gaps and negative misperceptions, including community-based and mass media communications, employer-based promotion, and group counseling. For supply of services, the lack of or inaccurate knowledge about vasectomy was also prevalent among providers, particularly among community-based health workers. Programmatic activities to improve service delivery included the use of evidence-based vasectomy techniques such as no-scalpel vasectomy, whole-site trainings, task shifting, cascade training, and mobile outreach. Finally, programmatic approaches to building a more enabling environment included engagement of governments and other community and religious leaders as well as campaigns with gender transformative messaging that countered common myths and encouraged men's positive engagement in family planning and reproductive health. In summary, a successful vasectomy program is comprised of the mutually reinforcing components of continual demand for services and access to and supply of well-trained providers. In addition, there is an underlying need for enabling policies within the cultural and gender environments that extend beyond vasectomy and include men not just as default partners of female family planning clients but as equal beneficiaries of family planning and reproductive health programs in their own right. Accelerating progress toward meaningful integration of vasectomy into a comprehensive contraceptive method mix is only possible when political and financial will are aligned and support the logistical and promotional activities of a male reproductive health agenda.\n© Shattuck et al.", "publication": "Glob Health Sci Pract. 2016 Dec 28;4(4):647-660. doi: 10.9745/GHSP-D-16-00235.

We utilized a logistic regression model to determine if vasectomy utilization varies based on offspring sex ratio while accounting for known factors that impact vasectomy utilization.\nRESULTS:\nOf these men, 30,927 (30.8%) underwent vasectomy. Marital status, race, age, education level, region or state, and number of offspring were all significantly correlated with vasectomy utilization (P < .01). The sex ratio for vasectomized fathers (51.3%) was significantly higher than for fathers who had not undergone vasectomy (50.7%, P < .01). This difference remained even after we stratified by the total number of offspring: vasectomized men with 4 or more children had a sex ratio of 947 girls per 1000 boys, whereas the no vasectomy group had a sex ratio of 983 girls per 1000 boys (P < .01). For men with at least 2 children, each additional son increased the likelihood of vasectomy by 4% (P < .01), whereas each additional daughter led to a 2% decrease in vasectomy utilization (P = .03).\nCONCLUSION:\nVasectomized fathers have a higher proportion of sons compared with non-vasectomized fathers, suggesting that offspring sex ratio is associated with a man's decision to undergo vasectomy. Further research is indicated to understand how offspring sex ratio impacts a man's contraceptive decisions.\nCopyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Vasectomy reversal procedures were identified by 3 current procedure terminology (CPT) codes: 55400 (vasovasostomy), 54900 (epididymovasostomy, unilateral), and 54901 (epididymovasostomy, bilateral). Demographic data were obtained and reviewed. Multivariate analysis determined the factors influencing the performance of surgical approach.\nRESULTS:\nThere were 5167 urologists who submitted case logs for 2008-2014, and 9.4% (486) had performed at least one vasectomy reversal procedure. General urologists accounted for the highest overall volume of vasectomy reversal procedures. Andrology-trained urologists performed a higher volume of vasovasostomy per surgeon, and bilateral epididymovasostomy constituted a greater portion of their E-V practice. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that being in recertification years, being younger in age, practicing in the South Central, Southeast, and Western regions, and practicing in the largest and smallest practice areas were associated with being more likely to perform a vasectomy reversal procedure.\nCONCLUSION:\nMicrosurgical vasectomy reversals are putatively considered technically challenging and reserved for fellowship-trained urologists, and the majority of vasectomy reversal surgeries were performed by general urologists. Given the known association between microsurgical technique and improved outcomes, greater emphasis should be placed on microsurgical training during urology residency.\nCopyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Between October 2016 and March 2017, we conducted a cross-sectional study examining the prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis and its association with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) other than HIV among pregnant women visiting antenatal clinics in Kisantu health zone, Democratic Republic of Congo. An extensive sociodemographic and clinical survey was administered to consenting participants, with urine samples and vaginal swabs collected to deduce active schistosomiasis and STIs, respectively. In total, 17.4% of expectant mothers were infected with Schistosoma haematobium, 3.1% with Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), 1.4% with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), and 14.6% with Trichomonas vaginalis (TV).

In the trial, participants were randomly allocated to receive a text message with the web link of an e-STI testing and results service (intervention group) or a text message with the link of a website listing the locations, contact details and websites of seven local sexual health clinics (control group). We analysed a subsample of 528 trial participants who reported never testing for STIs at baseline. Outcomes were self-reported STI testing at 6 weeks, verified by patient record checks, and time from randomisation to completion of an STI test.\nRESULTS:\nUptake of STI testing among 'never testers' almost doubled. At 6 weeks, 45.3% of the intervention completed at least one test (chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and HIV), compared with 24.1% of the control (relative risk [RR] 1.88, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.40, p<0.001). For chlamydia and gonorrhoea testing combined, uptake was 44.3% in the intervention versus 24.1% in controls (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.36, p<0.001). The intervention reduced time to any STI test (restricted mean survival time: 29.0 days vs 36.3 days, p<0.001) at a time horizon of 42 days. CONCLUSIONS : e-STI testing increased uptake of STI testing and reduced time to test among a young population of 'never testers' recruited in community settings. Although encouraging, questions remain on how best to manage the additional demand generated by e-STI testing in a challenging funding environment.

Different aspects of MCRPC research, including the countries/territories, institutions, journals, authors, research areas, funding agencies and author keywords, were analyzed.\nRESULTS:\nThe number of annual MCRPC publications increased rapidly after 2010. American researchers played a vital role in this increase, as they published the most publications. The most productive institution was Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. De Bono, JS (the United Kingdom [UK]) and Scher, HI (the United States of America [USA]) were the two most productive authors. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded the largest number of published papers.

We will evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture and moxibustion in the treatment of pain caused by prostate cancer using a clinical randomized parallel control method.\nMETHODS/DESIGN:\nThis pragmatic randomized controlled trial will recruit 120 patients who are diagnosed with prostate cancer. Simple randomization to conventional drug treatment with a 1:1 allocation ratio will be used. Based on the patient's pain location and the primary lesion, the acupuncture needle insertion position was determined according to the principle of local selection of acupoints.

We aimed to investigate whether novel imaging using prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET-CT might improve accuracy and affect management.\nMETHODS:\nIn this multicentre, two-arm, randomised study, we recruited men with biopsy-proven prostate cancer and high-risk features at ten hospitals in Australia. Patients were randomly assigned to conventional imaging with CT and bone scanning or gallium-68 PSMA-11 PET-CT. First-line imaging was done within 21 days following randomisation. Patients crossed over unless three or more distant metastases were identified. The primary outcome was accuracy of first-line imaging for identifying either pelvic nodal or distant-metastatic disease defined by the receiver-operating curve using a predefined reference-standard including histopathology, imaging, and biochemistry at 6-month follow-up. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ANZCTR12617000005358.\nFINDINGS:\nFrom March 22, 2017 to Nov 02, 2018, 339 men were assessed for eligibility and 302 men were randomly assigned. 152 (50%) men were randomly assigned to conventional imaging and 150 (50%) to PSMA PET-CT. Of 295 (98%) men with follow-up, 87 (30%) had pelvic nodal or distant metastatic disease. PSMA PET-CT had a 27% (95% CI 23-31) greater accuracy than that of conventional imaging (92% [88-95] vs 65% [60-69]; p<0·0001). We found a lower sensitivity (38% [24-52] vs 85% [74-96]) and specificity (91% [85-97] vs 98% [95-100]) for conventional imaging compared with PSMA PET-CT. Subgroup analyses also showed the superiority of PSMA PET-CT (area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve 91% vs 59% [32% absolute difference; 28-35] for patients with pelvic nodal metastases, and 95% vs 74% [22% absolute difference; 18-26] for patients with distant metastases). First-line conventional imaging conferred management change less frequently (23 [15%] men [10-22] vs 41 [28%] men [21-36]; p=0·008) and had more equivocal findings (23% [17-31] vs 7% [4-13]) than PSMA PET-CT did. Radiation exposure was 10·9 mSv (95% CI 9·8-12·0) higher for conventional imaging than for PSMA PET-CT (19·2 mSv vs 8·4 mSv; p<0·001). We found high reporter agreement for PSMA PET-CT (κ=0·87 for nodal and κ=0·88 for distant metastases). In patients who underwent second-line image, management change occurred in seven (5%) of 136 patients following conventional imaging, and in 39 (27%) of 146 following PSMA PET-CT.\nINTERPRETATION:\nPSMA PET-CT is a suitable replacement for conventional imaging, providing superior accuracy, to the combined findings of CT and bone scanning.\nFUNDING:\nMovember and Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia.

Biopsies performed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) targeting may reduce the misclassification of prostate cancer in men with MRI-visible lesions.\nMETHODS:\nMen with MRI-visible prostate lesions underwent both MRI-targeted and systematic biopsy. The primary outcome was cancer detection according to grade group (i.e., a clustering of Gleason grades). Grade group 1 refers to clinically insignificant disease; grade group 2 or higher, cancer with favorable intermediate risk or worse; and grade group 3 or higher, cancer with unfavorable intermediate risk or worse. Among the men who underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy, upgrading and downgrading of grade group from biopsy to whole-mount histopathological analysis of surgical specimens were recorded. Secondary outcomes were the detection of cancers of grade group 2 or higher and grade group 3 or higher, cancer detection stratified by previous biopsy status, and grade reclassification between biopsy and radical prostatectomy.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 2103 men underwent both biopsy methods; cancer was diagnosed in 1312 (62.4%) by a combination of the two methods (combined biopsy), and 404 (19.2%) underwent radical prostatectomy. Cancer detection rates on MRI-targeted biopsy were significantly lower than on systematic biopsy for grade group 1 cancers and significantly higher for grade groups 3 through 5 (P<0.01 for all comparisons). Combined biopsy led to cancer diagnoses in 208 more men (9.9%) than with either method alone and to upgrading to a higher grade group in 458 men (21.8%). However, if only MRI-target biopsies had been performed, 8.8% of clinically significant cancers (grade group ≥3) would have been misclassified. Among the 404 men who underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy, combined biopsy was associated with the fewest upgrades to grade group 3 or higher on histopathological analysis of surgical specimens (3.5%), as compared with MRI-targeted biopsy (8.7%) and systematic biopsy (16.8%).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nAmong patients with MRI-visible lesions, combined biopsy led to more detection of all prostate cancers. However, MRI-targeted biopsy alone underestimated the histologic grade of some tumors. After radical prostatectomy, upgrades to grade group 3 or higher on histopathological analysis were substantially lower after combined biopsy.

In the present study, we examined the expression of SNHG7 in prostate cancer tissues and in paired adjacent normal prostate tissues, and we further explored the clinical significance and prognostic value of SNHG7 in prostate cancer patients.A total of 127 prostate cancer tissues were collected from prostate cancer patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between April 2011 and March 2019 at the department of urology, Pudong New Area People's Hospital. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction experiment was performed to detect the relative expressions of SNHG7 in the prostate cancer tissues and normal prostate tissues. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to create survival curves and the log-rank test was used to determine statistical significance. A Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to evaluate the prognostic factors in univariate and multivariate analyses.Compared with paired adjacent normal prostatic tissues, SNHG7 expression was increased in prostate cancer tissues (P < .001).

The aim of this study was to determine whether the treatment dose-volume histogram (DVH) agrees with the planned dose to organs at risk (OAR).\nMETHODS:\n41 low-intermediate risk prostate cancer patients were treated with SABR using a linac based technique. Dose prescribed was 35 Gy in five fractions delivered on alternate days, planned using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with 10X flattening filter free (FFF). On treatment, prostate was matched to fiducial markers on cone beam CT (CBCT). OAR were retrospectively delineated on 205 pre-treatment CBCT images.

There was no statistically significant difference in median rectal volume at each of the five treatment scans compared to the planning scan (p = 0.99). This was also the case for median bladder volume (p = 0.79). The median dose received by rectum and bladder at each fraction was higher than planned, at the majority of dose levels.

PTT rates varied by study, ranging from 10-40%. PTT was less severe (based on number of trichiatic eyelashes) than initial trichiasis for 72% of those developing PTT, and only 2% of eyelids were worse at follow up than pre-operatively. Eyelids with central only-trichiasis pre-operatively had lower rates of PTT than eyelids with peripheral only trichiasis in each of the three trials that included severe TT cases. 10% of eyelids with peripheral trichiasis pre-operatively that develop PTT have central TT post-operatively.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:\nPre-operative central trichiasis is less likely than peripheral trichiasis to be associated with subsequent PTT. Regardless of type of surgery, surgeon skill levels, or pre-operative trichiasis severity, the presence of peripheral trichiasis pre-operatively is associated with higher rates of PTT.

It is unclear what mediates this mortality reduction, but one possibility is that antibiotics function as growth promoters for young children.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS:\n24 rural Ethiopian communities that had received biannual mass azithromycin distributions over the previous four years were enrolled in a parallel-group, cluster-randomized trial. Communities were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either continuation of biannual oral azithromycin (20mg/kg for children, 1 g for adults) or to no programmatic antibiotics over the 36 months of the study period. All community members 6 months and older were eligible for the intervention. The primary outcome was ocular chlamydia; height and weight were measured as secondary outcomes on children less than 60 months of age at months 12 and 36. Study participants were not masked; anthropometrists were not informed of the treatment allocation. Anthropometric measurements were collected for 282 children aged 0-36 months at the month 12 assessment and 455 children aged 0-59 months at the month 36 assessment, including 207 children who had measurements at both time points.

Neurosyphilis-attributed deaths in young patients have grown exponentially in the past decade, yet there have been few studies on the early stages of neurosyphilis.\nPATIENT CONCERNS:\nA young male patient with syphilitic cerebral arteritis was evaluated in our clinic for the clinical signs of progressive ischemic stroke.\nDIAGNOSIS:\nThe progression of syphilitic cerebral arteritis was observed through computed tomography imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiogram, and transcranial color Doppler. The pathological changes and clinical outcomes were reviewed. In this specific case, the development of syphilitic cerebral arteritis was dynamic, continuous, and rapid. The pathogenesis was related to Heubner arteritis, in which the formation of a mural thrombus (MT) causes the severe obstruction of blood flow without complete occlusion, leading to an increased risk of infarction. In this patient, formation of the MT resulted in the infarction of the smaller vessels and narrowing of the larger vessels. The partial dislodgment of the MT from the arterial wall of the larger vessels occluded the smaller vessels, leading to infarction.\nINTERVENTIONS:\nStandard pharmacotherapy for the treatment of the cerebral infarction and a single course of penicillin were applied.\nOUTCOMES:\nMuscle strength was recovered. The Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15, whereas the NIH Stroke Scale score was 0. The increase in blood flow of the right MCA was accompanied by severe stenosis with compensation of the anterior communicating artery. In addition, moderate to severe stenosis of the right vertebral artery and the basilar artery was suspected.

However, its intramuscular (IM) administration is associated with pain at the site of injection. The dilution of PGB with local anesthetics is recommended in some guidelines, but the evidence that supports it, particularly in adults and in HIV infection, is scarce. Preliminary clinical experience also suggests that the IM administration of PGB through increased needle gauges might improve its tolerability. The aim of the study to identify less painful ways of administering IM PGB in the treatment of syphilis in adults.\nMETHODS:\nMulticenter, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial in patients diagnosed with primary syphilis that required a single IM injection of PGB 2400,00 IU. Patients were randomized to receive PGB diluted with 0.5 mL mepivacaine 1% (MV) or PGB alone, and both groups either with a long 19G or short 21G IM needle. The primary objective was the effect on local pain immediately after the administration through a visual scale questionnaire on pain (0 to 10).\nRESULTS:\nOne hundred eight patients were included, 27 in each group. Ninety-four (94.4%) were male, and 41.7% were also HIV-infected. Mean age 36.6 years (SD 11). Significant differences in immediate pain intensity were observed when comparing the long 19G group with anesthesia (mean pain intensity, [MPI] 2.92 [CI 95% 1.08-4.07]) vs long 19G without anesthesia (MPI 5.56 [CI 95% 4.39-6.73), p < 0.001; and also between short 21G group with anesthesia (MPI 3.36 [CI 95% 2.22-4.50]) vs short 21G without anesthesia (MPI 5.06 [CI 95% 3.93-6.19]), p = 0.015). No significant differences in immediate pain were observed between 19G and 21G in the presence or absence of anesthesia (p = 1.0 in both cases). No differences were found between study arms after 6 and 24 h.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThe IM administration of 1% mepivacaine-diluted PGB induces significantly less immediate local pain as compared to PGB alone. The needle gauge did not have any effect on the pain. Based on these results, we suggest anesthetic-diluted IM PGB as the standard treatment for primary syphilis.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION:\nEudraCT 2014-003969-24 (Date of registration 18/09/2014).", "publication": "BMC Infect Dis. 2019 Oct 23;19(1):883. doi: 10.1186/s12879-019-4490-5.", "topic": "Syphilis", "authors": ["Estrada V", "Santiago E", "Cabezas I", "Cotano JL", "Carrió JC", "Fuentes-Ferrer M", "Vera M", "Ayerdi O", "Rodríguez C", "López L", "Cabello N", "Núñez MJ", "Puerta T", "Sagastagoitia I", "Del Romero J"], "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6813081/"}, {"references": null, "title": "Congenital Syphilis Misdiagnosed as Suspected Nonaccidental Trauma.", "abstract": "Abstract\nCongenital syphilis (CS) is a preventable infection, yet the incidence has surged to the highest rates in 20 years.

The outcome measures were International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), patient's global impression of changes (PGIC), maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax), postvoid residual urine volume (PVR), and frequency-volume chart.\nRESULTS:\nTotal IPSS (IG, -2.4 ± 4.2; CG, 0.9 ± 4.0; P = .039), PGIC-A (IG, 3.5 ± 1.0; CG, 2.2 ± 1.0; P = .001), and PGIC-B (IG, 3.5 ± 0.1; CG, 4.7 ± 0.6; P = .004) were significantly improved in the IG compared with the CG, 4 weeks after baseline. Among the IPSS items, incomplete emptying (IG, -0.6 ± 0.7; CG, 0.4 ± 1.2; P = .019), straining (IG, -0.6 ± 0.8; CG, 0.2 ± 1.2; P = .046), and nocturia (IG, -0.8 ± 1.4; CG, 0.1 ± 1.0; P = .045) showed significant differences. The Qmax and PVR volume did not differ significantly at 12 weeks after the baseline.\nCONCLUSION:\nMoxibustion can be considered an adjunct therapy to improve LUTS in BPE patients. A full-sized randomized controlled trial would be feasible with comparator modifications and an extended study period.

Bibliometric analyses are quantitative approaches examining the impact of academic literature. We used the following search terms and Boolean logic \"(\"benign prostat*\") AND (hyperplasia OR enlarg*)\" and characterized the 100 most-cited BPH articles through 2018 including citations, journal, author, year, and country.\nRESULTS:\nThe top 100 BPH articles were published between 1978 and 2012. Citations ranged from 153 to 2171 across 27 different journals, including 10 urology-specific journals. The Journal of Urology was the most published journal (n = 25), followed by European Urology (n = 17), and Urology (n = 15). In general, the oldest 10 articles focused on BPH etiology/pathogenesis, while the newest 10 focused on treatment. The 1990's was the most productive decade with nearly half of the top 100 articles (n = 44). Twenty-six different countries contributed to the top 100 articles, with the US (n = 74), Italy (n = 19), and Canada (n = 12) being the most common.\nCONCLUSION:\nThis study represents the first bibliometric analysis of the leading BPH articles impacting the academic literature.

Ejaculatory hood sparing vaporization was performed with preservation of the paracollicular and supracollicular tissue proximal to the verumontanum in 25 patients. Patients were assessed at baseline, and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively using the Ej-MSHQ (Ejaculatory Domain of Male Sexual Health Questionnaire) and the IIEF-15 (International Index of Erectile Function-15). The I-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Score), uroflowmetry and post-void residual urine volume were reported at each followup visit. A standard urodynamic study was performed at 6 months.\nRESULTS:\nAntegrade ejaculation was reported in 85% and 31.6% of patients after hood sparing and standard prostate vaporization, respectively (p=0.001). A significant reduction in the EJ-MSHQ score was reported after standard vaporization at 6 and 12 months (each p <0.001) with no significant difference after hood sparing vaporization (p=0.18 and 0.078, respectively). The median EJ-MSHQ score was 28.5 (range 1 to 33) and 27 (range 1 to 33) for hood sparing vaporization, and 9.5 (range 1 to 35) and 9 (range 0 to 33) for standard vaporization at 6 (p=0.005) and 12 months (p <0.001), respectively. Each group showed a decline in the mean total IIEF-15 score at 1 year but it was statistically significant only after standard vaporization (p=0.001). All urinary outcome measures revealed comparable significant improvement at all followups. Postoperative urodynamic assessment demonstrated a significant comparable decrease in the Bladder Outlet Obstruction Index from a median of 64 (range 21 to 207) to 23.5 (range 10 to 53) after hood sparing vaporization (p=0.005) and from 87 (range 38 to 186) to 19.5 (range 7 to 51) after standard vaporization (p=0.001). At 1 year the overall re-treatment rate was comparable in the 2 groups (p=0.26).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nIn well informed, sexually interested patients ejaculatory hood sparing GreenLight prostate photoselective vaporization is feasible and effective treatment of small to moderate sized benign prostatic hyperplasia with a superior sexual function related outcome.

The primary outcomes were the maximal flow rate (Qmax) and international prostate symptoms score (IPSS) at 12 months after surgical treatment. Secondary outcomes were Qmax and IPSS values at 6, 24, and 36 months after surgical treatment; perioperative parameters; and surgical complications.\nDATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS:\nTwo independent reviewers extracted the study data and performed quality assessments using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. The effect sizes were summarised using weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes and odds ratios for binary outcomes. Frequentist approach to the network meta-analysis was used to estimate comparative effects and safety. Ranking probabilities of each treatment were also calculated.\nRESULTS:\n109 trials with a total of 13 676 participants were identified. Nine surgical treatments were evaluated. Enucleation achieved better Qmax and IPSS values than resection and vapourisation methods at six and 12 months after surgical treatment, and the difference maintained up to 24 and 36 months after surgical treatment. For Qmax at 12 months after surgical treatment, the best three methods compared with monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) were bipolar enucleation (mean difference 2.42 mL/s (95% confidence interval 1.11 to 3.73)), diode laser enucleation (1.86 (-0.17 to 3.88)), and holmium laser enucleation (1.07 (0.07 to 2.08)). The worst performing method was diode laser vapourisation (-1.90 (-5.07 to 1.27)). The results of IPSS at 12 months after treatment were similar to Qmax at 12 months after treatment. The best three methods, versus monopolar TURP, were diode laser enucleation (mean difference -1.00 (-2.41 to 0.40)), bipolar enucleation (0.87 (-1.80 to 0.07)), and holmium laser enucleation (-0.84 (-1.51 to 0.58)). The worst performing method was diode laser vapourisation (1.30 (-1.16 to 3.76)). Eight new methods were better at controlling bleeding than monopolar TURP, resulting in a shorter catheterisation duration, reduced postoperative haemoglobin declination, fewer clot retention events, and lower blood transfusion rate. However, short term transient urinary incontinence might still be a concern for enucleation methods, compared with resection methods (odds ratio 1.92, 1.39 to 2.65). No substantial inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence was detected in primary or secondary outcomes.\nCONCLUSION:\nEight new endoscopic surgical methods for benign prostatic hyperplasia appeared to be superior in safety compared with monopolar TURP. Among these new treatments, enucleation methods showed better Qmax and IPSS values than vapourisation and resection methods.\nSTUDY REGISTRATION:\nCRD42018099583.\nPublished by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Since conventional pharmacotherapy for LUTS/BPH can lead to sexual side effects, herbal therapies are widely used as complementary and alternative treatments worldwide. HT080 is an herbal extract of Cinnamomum cassia and Rosa Laevigata, both of which have been used to treat symptoms typically associated with BPH in traditional Asian medicine. The aims of this trial are to assess whether HT080 can alleviate LUTS/BPH in middle-aged and elderly men, and to investigate the safety of HT080.\nMETHODS/DESIGN:\nA double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-arm parallel group trial will be conducted in men with moderate LUTS/BPH. A total of 100 eligible men aged 40 to 75 years with an International Prostate Symptom Score of 8 to 19 will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio and receive either HT080 (500 mg) or placebo twice a day for 12 weeks. All participants will be evaluated for efficacy and safety at baseline and weeks 6 and 12. The primary endpoint is the change in International Prostate Symptom Score between baseline and week 12. The secondary efficacy variables are uroflowmetry parameters (maximal urinary flow rate and post-void residual volume), serum prostate-specific antigen, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone levels, the International Index of Erectile Function score, and participant-reported global response assessment scores. The safety assessments include adverse events, laboratory tests results, vital signs, and physical examination.\nDISCUSSION:\nThis is a first-in human trial designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of HT080 among middle-aged and elderly men with LUTS/BPH.

In this context, preclinical and clinical research oriented their interest toward natural compounds efficacy and safety, supporting the development of a new \"nutraceutical\" science. Medicinal plants, in the form of plant parts or extracts of them, are commonly used for the treatment of prostate diseases such as benign hypertrophy, prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome. The pharmacological properties searched for the treatment of prostatic diseases are anti-androgenic, anti-estrogenic, antiproliferative, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. The most studied and used medicinal plants are Serenoa repens, Pygeum africanum and Urtica dioica. Other promising plants are Cucurbita pepo, Epilobium spp, Lycopersum esculentum, Secale cereale, Roystonea regia, Vaccinium macrocarpon. In parallel, epidemiological studies demonstrated that diet may play an important role on incidence and development of prostatic diseases. The Mediterranean diet is rich of elements with anti-oxidant properties that act as a protective factor for prostatic cancer. Similarly, low intake of animal protein, high intake of fruits and vegetable, lycopene and zinc are a protective factor for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Serenoa repens in the treatment of symptoms of BPH has been tested either alone or, more frequently, in combination with other medicinal plants, alpha-blockers and inhibitors of 5- alpha reductase (5-ARI). Recent meta-analyses found the effectiveness of Serenoa repens similar or inferior of that of finasteride and tamsulosin but clearly higher than that of placebo in the treatment of mild and moderate low urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), nocturia and discomfort. Clinical trials showed potential synergistic effect of Serenoa repens with other medicinal plants and drugs. In addition to Serenoa repens, there are many other medicinal plants for which clinical evidence is still controversial. Urtica dioica, Pygeum africanum and Curcubita pepo can be considered as an adjunct to the common therapies and their use is supported by studies showing improvement of symptoms and flowmetric indices. Lycopene and selenium are natural products with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory action. The combination of lycopene and selenium with Serenoa repens was able to reduce inflammation in histological prostate sections and to further improve symptom scores and urinary flow in patients with BPH on tamsulosin treatment. Similar effects could be obtained with the use of other carotenoids, such as astaxanthin, and/or zinc. Efficacy on symptoms of patients with BPH of some polyphenols such as quercitin, equol and curcumin have been demonstrated by clinical studies. Pollen extract is a mixture of natural components able to inhibit several cytokines and prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis resulting in a potent anti-inflammatory effect. Pollen extracts significantly improve symptoms, pain, and quality of life in patients affected by chronic pelvic pain syndrome and chronic prostatitis. Beta-sitosterol is a sterol able to improve urinary symptoms and flow measures, but not to reduce the size of the prostate gland. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an endogenous fatty acid amide-signaling molecule with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects that can have an interesting role in the management of chronic pelvic pain syndrome and chronic urological pain. Finally, several plant-based products have been subjected to preclinical, in vitro and in vivo, investigations for their potential pharmacological activity against prostate cancer. Some epidemiological studies or clinical trials evaluated the effects of beverages, extracts or food preparations on the risk of prostate cancer. Some plant species deserved more intense investigation, such as Camelia sinensis (green or black tea), Solanum lycopersicum (common tomato), Punica granatum (pomegranate), Glycine max (common soy) and Linum usitatissimum (linen).", "publication": "Arch Ital Urol Androl. 2019 Oct 2;91(3). doi: 10.4081/aiua.2019.3.139.", "topic": "Enlarged Prostate (BPH)", "authors": ["Cicero AFG", "Allkanjari O", "Busetto GM", "Cai T", "Larganà G", "Magri V", "Perletti G", "Robustelli Della Cuna FS", "Russo GI", "Stamatiou K", "Trinchieri A", "Vitalone A"], "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.4081/aiua.2019.3.139"}, {"references": null, "title": "What Are Factors Contributing to Improvement of Overactive Bladder Symptoms after Alpha-1 Blocker Treatment in Patients with Both Storage and Voiding Symptoms?", "abstract": "Abstract\nINTRODUCTION:\nTo determine the pre-treatment factors related to the improvement of overactive bladder (OAB) symptom after alpha-1 blocker monotherapy in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia complicated by OAB (BPH/OAB).\nMETHODS:\nPost-hoc analysis of a prospective study in patients with BPH/OAB, randomized to receive silodosin 8 mg (n = 157) or naftopidil 75 mg (n = 157) treatment for 12 weeks, was performed.

In this study, we compared results of bipolar TURP using the resection loop versus vaporization button for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) to determine the relative safety profile.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\nBetween January 2013 and March 2014, 89 patients with BPH were randomized to surgical intervention either by Olympus (Gyrus) Bipolar loop TURP or Olympus (Gyrus) Bipolar button vaporization. Inclusion criteria were; BPH with Q-max < 10 ml/s, IPSS  > 18 and prostate volume > 40 g. All patients were evaluated preoperatively and at 1, 3 and 9 months. Evaluation included IPSS, uroflowmetry, prostate volume by ultrasound. Clavien complications and operative time were recorded.

Preoperative mean prostate volume (59 g versus 58 g, p = 0.52) and mean IPSS (19 versus 20, p = 0.38) were equivalent in both groups.

Adherence to medications is considered a core element to improve patients' clinical outcomes. Objective To evaluate the role of clinical pharmacist in improving adherence to medication, reducing severity of symptoms, and improving quality of life in this group of patients. Setting The study was conducted in urology outpatients' clinics in Amman, Jordan. Methods This was a prospective randomized controlled trial, patients were randomly allocated into intervention group or control group. Patients in the intervention group were offered a pharmaceutical care service and patients in the control group received regular healthcare provided by urologist and then followed for 1 month. Main outcome measures Morisky Medication Adherence Score and International Prostate Symptom Score. Results Among 209 patients completed the study, 105 were in the intervention group and 104 in the control group. By the end of the study, 91.4% of the intervention group patients became adherent to their medication compared to 72.1% in the control group (p < 0.0001).

The 2018 Urologic Diseases in America Project attempted to fill this gap by analyzing multiple large administrative claims databases which include men of all ages and permit longitudinal followup. To our knowledge we report these findings for the first time in the scientific literature.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\nThe 2 data sources used in this study included the de-identified Optum® Clinformatics® Data Mart database for men 40 to 64 years old and the Medicare 5% Sample for men 65 years old or older. To assess trends in lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia related medication prescriptions and surgical procedures from 2004 to 2013 we created annual cross-sectional cohorts and a longitudinal cohort of patients with incident lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia and 5 years of followup.\nRESULTS:\nThe use of medications related to lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia increased with age, particularly among men 40 to 60 years old. While medication use increased with time, surgical procedures decreased. Increasing age correlated with a higher rate of surgical procedures in the longitudinal cohort. Younger men were more likely to elect treatments of lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia which reportedly optimize sexual function.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nMedication use increased and surgery decreased during the study period. Treatment approaches to lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia varied greatly by patient age. While the minority of men in the fifth and sixth decades of life required treatment, a sharp increase in treatment use was seen between these decades.

Patients in group A were subjected to B-TUERP while those in group B underwent B-TURP. The perioperative data and postoperative outcomes followed at 1, 6, and 24 months after surgery at which points they were analyzed, and a comparison made between the 2 groups.\nRESULTS:\nThere were no significant differences in the preoperative parameters of the 2 groups. Comparing with B-TURP, B-TUERP had longer operative time (105.09 ± 31.08 vs 61.09 ± 29.28 min), more resected prostatic tissue (50.41 ± 13.07 vs41.12 ± 8.91 g) and had less hemoglobin drop (1.5 vs 2g/dL). In addition, indwelling catheter time, postoperative bladder irrigation duration, and hospital stay were significantly shorter in the B-TUERP group than in the B-TURP group. At 24 month after the procedure, patients with B-TUERP achieved better results of International Prostate Symptom Score (6 vs 7 P = .008), quality of life (1 vs 2, P = .243), maximal flow rate (24.9 ± 5.74 vs 20.09 ± 3.27mL/sec, P = .034), post-voiding residual urine volume (18.64 ± 3.28 vs 24.74 ± 4.02 mL, P = .001), and residual prostate volume (18.64 ± 3.28 vs 20.74 ± 4.02 mL, P < .001).

We review (1) the histologic definition of prostatic inflammation and its prevalence, (2) the effects inflammation in the prostate including on risk of acute urinary retention, and (3) the effects of systemic inflammation on the prostate and on voiding.\nRECENT FINDINGS:\nInflammation is a highly prevalent finding in the prostate, both on a histological and biochemical level. Men with inflammation have higher IPSS scores and increased prostate size; however, these differences appear to be imperceptibly small. Men with inflammation do experience a significantly increased risk of developing acute urinary retention, an event that is associated with significant morbidity. Recently, attempts have been made to identify more specific biochemical markers of local inflammation, and to identify regional patterns of inflamed tissue within the prostate which may be associated with higher IPSS scores, accelerated progression, and AUR. The effects of systemic inflammatory states, most notably MetS, and their role in LUTS have also been examined. Inflammation is a common finding in prostates of aging men, but its contribution to lower urinary tract symptoms and benign prostatic hyperplasia progression appears to be small when considered as a clinically relevant entity. Advances in the understanding of different forms of inflammation, and their impact when experienced in different locations within the prostate, may refine this knowledge. Systemic inflammation affects voiding, including in the absence of a prostate, but again significant effects of systemic inflammation on the prostate itself are also difficult to demonstrate. Prostatic inflammation is associated with a significantly increased risk of acute urinary retention.", "publication": "Curr Urol Rep. 2019 Aug 3;20(9):54. doi: 10.1007/s11934-019-0917-1.", "topic": "Enlarged Prostate (BPH)", "authors": ["Lloyd GL", "Marks JM", "Ricke WA"], "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11934-019-0917-1"}, {"references": null, "title": "Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) IgG index values in two immunoassays in relation to HSV-2 IgG inhibition assay results.", "abstract": "Abstract\nCDC guidelines recommend confirmatory testing of sera with low-positive indices (1.10-3.50) in the HerpeSelect® (HSLT) HSV-2 IgG screening assay.

They may display a vast array of forms, according to the interaction of the virus with the host's immunity. Cellular immunity is the epithelium's main form of defense against the virus, involving an active participation of the Langerhans cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α.\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo assess the epithelial immune response of anogenital warts in males, according to the number of lesions presented.\nMETHODS:\nThis is a prospective, cross-sectional study carried out at the dermatology outpatient clinic in a tertiary hospital. We included male patients over 18 years of age without comorbidities who had anogenital condylomata and no previous treatments.In order to evaluate the local epithelial immunity, the lesions were quantified, then removed and employed in CD1a immunohistochemistry assays for assessing the morphometry and morphology of Langerhans cells; TNF-α; reaction was used for determining cytokine positivity in the epithelium.\nRESULTS:\n48 patients were included in the study. There was no statistically significant difference as to the number of Langerhans cells, in their morphology, or the presence of TNF-α. However, patients presenting with more Langerhans cells in the lesions had cells with a star-like and dendritic morphology, whereas in those with a lower cell count had cells with a rounded morphology and no dendrites (p<0.001).\nSTUDY LIMITATIONS:\nSmall number of patients analyzed.\nCONCLUSION:\nThere was no difference in epithelial immunity between patients having few or many anogenital condyloma lesions as measured by the morphology and morphometry of Langerhans cells and TNF-α; positivity. Such an assessment employing immunity markers differing from the usual ones is expected to yield useful results.\nCopyright © 2020 Sociedade Brasileira de Dermatologia.

These entail benign infections like genital warts as well as malignant, life-threatening conditions such as cervical cancer. Since a very high mortality rate is associated with HPV caused cancers (cervical cancer is a 2nd leading cause of death caused due to cancer among women globally), there is an escalating need to understand and search for ways to combat such medical conditions. Under the same light, the given article provides an insight into the world of this versatile pathogen. Distinct aspects related to HPV have been discussed here. Emphasis has been laid upon the composition, function and assembly of capsid proteins (structural studies) and various genetic elements and their gene products (genomic studies). The essence of the mechanism behind the development of persistent infection and modes responsible for the transmission of the infectious particles has been briefly covered.

We studied 51 cases of condyloma acuminatum of the urinary bladder from transurethral resections of the urinary bladder of 38 patients from the consult files of one of the authors. Transurethral resections of the urinary bladder were obtained from 25 males with a median age of 73 years (range: 41 to 87 y) and 13 females with a median age of 68 years (range: 30 to 86 y). The follow-up period ranged from 15 months to 20 years (median: 6 y). Bladder lesions were accompanied by urethral lesions in 4 men. Eight patients (8/38; 21.0%) had a history of immunosuppression. Seven patients (7/8; 87.5%) from this group had multiple and/or recurrent condylomas. One patient (1/38; 2.6%) with renal transplantation had 10 separate bladder condylomas over time. One patient (1/38; 2.6%) had extensive anogenital condylomas and anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3. One patient (1/8; 12.5%) with renal transplantation presented with a solitary condyloma with synchronous squamous cell carcinoma in situ. Three female patients (3/38; 7.9%) had a history of premalignant vagina/cervix lesions. In total, 17 patients (17/38; 44.7%) had squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder, either invasive or in situ. In all cases, the squamous cell carcinoma (either in situ or invasive) was diagnosed either concurrent with the diagnosis of bladder condyloma or within 1 year of the condyloma diagnosis). In total, 9 of 38 (23.7%) patients had invasive squamous cell carcinoma with or without in situ squamous cell carcinoma. Eight of 38 (21.0%) patients had squamous cell carcinoma in situ only (without a definitive invasive component-in 3 cases invasive squamous cell carcinoma could not be excluded with certainty). In total, 19 patients (19/38; 50%) were positive for either low-risk human papillomavirus (LR-HPV) or high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) or both (3 were positive for both LR-HPV and HR-HPV, 12 patients for only LR-HPV, and 4 for only HR-HPV). Of the 19 patients that were negative for both LR-HPV and HR-HPV, 9 of 19 (47.4%) patients had associated squamous cell carcinoma. Of the 12 patients with only LR-HPV, 4 (33.3%) had associated squamous cell carcinoma (either invasive or in situ). Of the 7 patients with HR-HPV (with or without LR-HPV), 4 (57.1%) has associated squamous cell carcinoma. In summary, condyloma acuminatum of the urinary bladder shows a strong association with squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder, regardless of the condyloma's HPV in situ hybridization results. Immunosuppression is associated with condylomas of the bladder. It is important to distinguish bladder condylomas from papillary urothelial carcinoma, given their different risks for panurothelial disease and risk of squamous cell carcinoma. Recognition of bladder condylomas histologically is often challenging given their rarity, and that they can be negative for both LR-HPV and HR-HPV. The lack of a history of other anogenital human papillomavirus-related lesions further increases the difficulty in establishing the correct diagnosis.", "publication": "Am J Surg Pathol. 2019 Nov;43(11):1547-1553. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0000000000001339.", "topic": "Genital Warts", "authors": ["Samarska IV", "Epstein JI"], "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1097/PAS.0000000000001339"}, {"references": null, "title": "Effect of 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy on the expression of apoptosis inhibitors Bcl-2 and Survivin in keratinocytes of condyloma acuminatum.", "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nCondyloma acuminatum is a highly infectious disease caused by the human papillomavirus. Previous studies have shown that 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy can inhibit proliferation of condyloma acuminatum keratinocytes. However, the effect of 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy on condyloma acuminatum tissues has not been systematically studied. Here, we investigated possible molecular mechanisms of 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy in the treatment of condyloma acuminatum and its effect on the expression of apoptosis inhibitors Bcl-2 and Survivin.\nMETHODS:\nImmunohistochemistry streptavidin-peroxidase was used to detect the expression of apoptosis inhibitors Bcl-2 and Survivin in condyloma acuminatum keratinocytes before and after the therapy.\nRESULTS:\nThe positive expression rates of Bcl-2 and Survivin in condyloma acuminatum keratinocytes before treatment were 87.50% (42/48) and 79.16% (38/48), respectively. The positive expression rates of Bcl-2 and Survivin in condyloma acuminatum keratinocytes after treatment were 37.50% (18/48) and 41.67% (20/48), respectively. The positive expression intensity of Bcl-2 and Survivin in condyloma acuminatum keratinocytes before 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy was mostly ++ to +++, and that after treatment was mostly - to +. There were statistically significant differences in the positive expression rate and the expression intensity of Bcl-2 and Survivin in the two groups before and after 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (P <  0.001). There was a positive correlation between the expression of Bcl-2 and Survivin in condyloma acuminatum tissues after 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (r = 0.480, P <  0.05).\nCONCLUSION:\n5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy may promote apoptosis of condyloma acuminatum cells by reducing the expression of Bcl-2 and Survivin, suggesting that this is potentially one of the molecular mechanisms of 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy in the treatment of condyloma acuminatum.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore it is crucial to evaluate PDT for safety and its impact on fertility and delivery of healthy newborns.\nOBJECTIVE:\nThe study analyzed the PDT treatment of 10 young women, who suffered from diseases of the vulva and cervix. The aim of the analysis was evaluating what impact PDT treatment had on their pregnancies and delivery.\nMETHODS:\n10 patients (22-32 years of age, 25.5 years of age on average) were treated with PDT in 2007-2014. 2 patients suffered from squamous cell hyperplasia, 2 patients from vulvar lichen sclerosus, 1 - genital warts, 1 - VIN I (current terminology: LSIL/Flat condyloma), 2 - CIN III (HSIL), 2 - CIN I (LSIL). The patients underwent photodynamic therapy (PDT). In the course of PDT the 5% 5- aminolevulinic acid was used in gel form three hours before irradiation. The affected areas were irradiated with a halogen lamp PhotoDyn 501 (590-760 nm) during a 10-min radiation treatment. The treatment was repeated weekly for 10 weeks.\nRESULTS:\nThe median observation time period between the end of therapy and delivery was 3.92 years (2-7 years). None of the patients suffered from infertility. All patients gave birth to healthy, full-term infants. In case of one pregnancy cervical cerclage was needed. Two patients were treated for hypothyroidism caused by the Hashimoto disease. One patient had gestational diabetes. Two patients had already given birth to 2 children. Five patients gave birth by caesarean section.\nCONCLUSION:\nTopical PDT selectively used for treating the diseases of the female reproductive organs was applied in our group of patients and proved to be a safe method.

Our aim was to evaluate the long-term recurrence of genital warts after primary carbon dioxide laser treatment before the introduction of the vaccination against HPV.\nMETHODS:\nRecurrence rate and localization of genital warts were analysed in a retrospective study in 1798 women presenting with a new diagnosis of genital warts from 1992 to 2009 at a University hospital and had received laser treatment. Additionally, data on topography, pregnancy status, and cervical smear were available for women treated from 2003 to 2009 (n = 825, data subset 1) and systematic follow-up data for women treated in 2006 and 2007 (n = 242, data subset 2).\nRESULTS:\nMedian time from laser treatment to first recurrence was 14.6 weeks (data subset 2). The site most affected was the vulva (90.7%) followed by the perineum/perianal region (59.3%) and the vagina (47.3%). Abnormal Pap smear was observed in 22.6%.

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of the population-level impact of vaccinating girls and women against human papillomavirus on HPV infections, anogenital wart diagnoses, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+ (CIN2+) to summarise the most recent evidence about the effectiveness of HPV vaccines in real-world settings and to quantify the impact of multiple age-cohort vaccination.\nMETHODS:\nIn this updated systematic review and meta-analysis, we used the same search strategy as in our previous paper. We searched MEDLINE and Embase for studies published between Feb 1, 2014, and Oct 11, 2018. Studies were eligible if they compared the frequency (prevalence or incidence) of at least one HPV-related endpoint (genital HPV infections, anogenital wart diagnoses, or histologically confirmed CIN2+) between pre-vaccination and post-vaccination periods among the general population and if they used the same population sources and recruitment methods before and after vaccination. Our primary assessment was the relative risk (RR) comparing the frequency (prevalence or incidence) of HPV-related endpoints between the pre-vaccination and post-vaccination periods. We stratified all analyses by sex, age, and years since introduction of HPV vaccination. We used random-effects models to estimate pooled relative risks.\nFINDINGS:\nWe identified 1702 potentially eligible articles for this systematic review and meta-analysis, and included 65 articles in 14 high-income countries: 23 for HPV infection, 29 for anogenital warts, and 13 for CIN2+. After 5-8 years of vaccination, the prevalence of HPV 16 and 18 decreased significantly by 83% (RR 0·17, 95% CI 0·11-0·25) among girls aged 13-19 years, and decreased significantly by 66% (RR 0·34, 95% CI 0·23-0·49) among women aged 20-24 years. The prevalence of HPV 31, 33, and 45 decreased significantly by 54% (RR 0·46, 95% CI 0·33-0·66) among girls aged 13-19 years. Anogenital wart diagnoses decreased significantly by 67% (RR 0·33, 95% CI 0·24-0·46) among girls aged 15-19 years, decreased significantly by 54% (RR 0·46, 95% CI 0.36-0.60) among women aged 20-24 years, and decreased significantly by 31% (RR 0·69, 95% CI 0·53-0·89) among women aged 25-29 years. Among boys aged 15-19 years anogenital wart diagnoses decreased significantly by 48% (RR 0·52, 95% CI 0·37-0·75) and among men aged 20-24 years they decreased significantly by 32% (RR 0·68, 95% CI 0·47-0·98). After 5-9 years of vaccination, CIN2+ decreased significantly by 51% (RR 0·49, 95% CI 0·42-0·58) among screened girls aged 15-19 years and decreased significantly by 31% (RR 0·69, 95% CI 0·57-0·84) among women aged 20-24 years.\nINTERPRETATION:\nThis updated systematic review and meta-analysis includes data from 60 million individuals and up to 8 years of post-vaccination follow-up. Our results show compelling evidence of the substantial impact of HPV vaccination programmes on HPV infections and CIN2+ among girls and women, and on anogenital warts diagnoses among girls, women, boys, and men.

Autophagy plays an important role in maintaining internal environmental stability. However, the role of autophagy regulation in the anogenital warts caused by HPV infection remains unknown.\nOBJECTIVE:\nA multigroup case-control study was designed to identify the autophagy gene fingerprint involved in anogenital warts arising from infections with different HPV genotypes.\nMETHODS:\nHuman autophagy PCR arrays were performed on the initial 18 participants grouped by their different HPV genotypes for gene expression-profiling analysis. The negative control was skin samples collected during plastic surgery on the chest from a group of individuals who showed none of the clinical symptoms or evidence of HPV infection. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to validate the microarray results in another 24 individuals.\nRESULTS:\nOut of 84 genes involved in autophagy, different autophagic responses were found among the 29 genes that encode autophagy machinery components, and expression levels of 13 of these genes were downregulated. Finally, we verified that the expression levels of 2 key genes that participate in the formation of autophagosomes, ATG3 and -BECLIN1, were downregulated in the HPV infection groups independently of genotype compared with the control group.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThese findings showed that HPV infection downregulated the expression of ATGs in CA. Additionally, there were no differences in the expression of ATGs between the different HPV genotype infection groups.

Demographic data, side effects, and outcomes of therapy were recorded for each patient, and overall efficacy was determined.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 37 patients met inclusion criteria. Responses were seen in 8 out of 9 patients treated with sinecatechins 15% ointment (5 full, 3 partial, and 1 no response) and 9 out of 17 patients treated with imiquimod 5% cream (4 full, 5 partial, and 8 no response). Combination therapy with one or more of the following treatments (podophyllin, cimetidine, candida antigen injection, and HPV vaccine) were evaluated, but no combination was objectively superior to the others. No significant difference was found in overall efficacy between sinecatechins and imiquimod. Side effects were mild and limited to irritation and erythema.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nBoth imiquimod 5% cream and sinecatechins 15% ointment are moderately effective in the treatment of AV in preadolescent children, with a trend toward greater effectiveness of sinecatechins. Combination therapy with other treatments did not significantly increase the effectiveness of topical therapies.

However, incidence is low and acyclovir, the treatment of choice, carries risk of toxicity. We aimed to increase the percentage of patients 0 to 60 days of age who are tested and treated for HSV in accordance with local guideline recommendations from 40% to 80%.\nMETHODS:\nThis quality improvement project took place at 1 freestanding children's hospital. Multiple plan-do-study-act cycles were focused on interventions aimed at key drivers including provider buy-in, guideline availability, and accurate identification of high-risk patients. A run chart was used to track the effect of interventions on the percentage managed per guideline recommendations over time by using established rules for determining special cause. Pre- and postimplementation acyclovir use was compared by using a χ2 test. In HSV-positive cases, delayed acyclovir initiation, defined as >1 day from presentation, was tracked as a balancing measure.\nRESULTS:\nThe median percentage of patients managed according to guideline recommendations increased from 40% to 80% within 8 months. Acyclovir use decreased from 26% to 7.9% (P < .001) in non-high-risk patients but did not change significantly in high-risk patients (73%-83%; P = .15). There were no cases of delayed acyclovir initiation in HSV-positive cases.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nPoint-of-care availability of an evidence-based guideline and interventions targeted at provider engagement improved adherence to a new guideline for neonatal HSV management and decreased acyclovir use in non-high-risk infants. Further study is necessary to confirm the safety of these recommendations in other settings.\nCopyright © 2019 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.", "publication": "Pediatrics. 2019 Aug;144(2). pii: e20180262. doi: 10.1542/peds.2018-0262.", "topic": "Herpes Simplex", "authors": ["Brower LH", "Wilson PM", "Murtagh Kurowski E", "Haslam D", "Courter J", "Goyal N", "Durling M", "Shah SS", "Schondelmeyer A"], "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2018-0262"}, {"references": null, "title": "Toll-like receptors as novel therapeutic targets for herpes simplex virus infection.", "abstract": "Abstract\nSeropositivity for HSV reaches more than 70% within the world population, and yet no approved vaccine exists. While HSV1 is responsible for keratitis, encephalitis, and labialis, HSV2 carriers have a high susceptibility to other STD infections, such as HIV. Induction of antiviral innate immune responses upon infection depends on a family of pattern recognition receptors called Toll-like receptors (TLR). TLRs bridge innate and adaptive immunity by sensing virus infection and activating antiviral immune responses. HSV adopts smart tricks to evade innate immunity and can also manipulate TLR signaling to evade the immune system or even confer destructive effects in favor of virus replication. Here, we review mechanisms by which HSV can trick TLR signaling to impair innate immunity. Then, we analyze the role of HSV-mediated molecular cues, in particular, NF-κB signaling, in promoting protective versus destructive effects of TLRs. Finally, TLR-based therapeutic opportunities with the goal of preventing or treating HSV infection will be discussed.\n© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "publication": "Rev Med Virol. 2019 Jul;29(4):e2048. doi: 10.1002/rmv.2048.

Bibliometric analyses are quantitative approaches examining the impact of academic literature. We used the following search terms and Boolean logic \"(\"benign prostat*\") AND (hyperplasia OR enlarg*)\" and characterized the 100 most-cited BPH articles through 2018 including citations, journal, author, year, and country.\nRESULTS:\nThe top 100 BPH articles were published between 1978 and 2012. Citations ranged from 153 to 2171 across 27 different journals, including 10 urology-specific journals. The Journal of Urology was the most published journal (n = 25), followed by European Urology (n = 17), and Urology (n = 15). In general, the oldest 10 articles focused on BPH etiology/pathogenesis, while the newest 10 focused on treatment. The 1990's was the most productive decade with nearly half of the top 100 articles (n = 44). Twenty-six different countries contributed to the top 100 articles, with the US (n = 74), Italy (n = 19), and Canada (n = 12) being the most common.\nCONCLUSION:\nThis study represents the first bibliometric analysis of the leading BPH articles impacting the academic literature. The focus has evolved from BPH pathogenesis to treatment, perhaps reflecting a shift in research funding and capacity. These findings may guide research priorities for this increasingly common condition.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Ejaculatory hood sparing vaporization was performed with preservation of the paracollicular and supracollicular tissue proximal to the verumontanum in 25 patients. Patients were assessed at baseline, and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively using the Ej-MSHQ (Ejaculatory Domain of Male Sexual Health Questionnaire) and the IIEF-15 (International Index of Erectile Function-15). The I-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Score), uroflowmetry and post-void residual urine volume were reported at each followup visit. A standard urodynamic study was performed at 6 months.\nRESULTS:\nAntegrade ejaculation was reported in 85% and 31.6% of patients after hood sparing and standard prostate vaporization, respectively (p=0.001). A significant reduction in the EJ-MSHQ score was reported after standard vaporization at 6 and 12 months (each p <0.001) with no significant difference after hood sparing vaporization (p=0.18 and 0.078, respectively). The median EJ-MSHQ score was 28.5 (range 1 to 33) and 27 (range 1 to 33) for hood sparing vaporization, and 9.5 (range 1 to 35) and 9 (range 0 to 33) for standard vaporization at 6 (p=0.005) and 12 months (p <0.001), respectively. Each group showed a decline in the mean total IIEF-15 score at 1 year but it was statistically significant only after standard vaporization (p=0.001). All urinary outcome measures revealed comparable significant improvement at all followups. Postoperative urodynamic assessment demonstrated a significant comparable decrease in the Bladder Outlet Obstruction Index from a median of 64 (range 21 to 207) to 23.5 (range 10 to 53) after hood sparing vaporization (p=0.005) and from 87 (range 38 to 186) to 19.5 (range 7 to 51) after standard vaporization (p=0.001). At 1 year the overall re-treatment rate was comparable in the 2 groups (p=0.26).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nIn well informed, sexually interested patients ejaculatory hood sparing GreenLight prostate photoselective vaporization is feasible and effective treatment of small to moderate sized benign prostatic hyperplasia with a superior sexual function related outcome.

The primary outcomes were the maximal flow rate (Qmax) and international prostate symptoms score (IPSS) at 12 months after surgical treatment. Secondary outcomes were Qmax and IPSS values at 6, 24, and 36 months after surgical treatment; perioperative parameters; and surgical complications.\nDATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS:\nTwo independent reviewers extracted the study data and performed quality assessments using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. The effect sizes were summarised using weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes and odds ratios for binary outcomes. Frequentist approach to the network meta-analysis was used to estimate comparative effects and safety. Ranking probabilities of each treatment were also calculated.\nRESULTS:\n109 trials with a total of 13 676 participants were identified. Nine surgical treatments were evaluated. Enucleation achieved better Qmax and IPSS values than resection and vapourisation methods at six and 12 months after surgical treatment, and the difference maintained up to 24 and 36 months after surgical treatment. For Qmax at 12 months after surgical treatment, the best three methods compared with monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) were bipolar enucleation (mean difference 2.42 mL/s (95% confidence interval 1.11 to 3.73)), diode laser enucleation (1.86 (-0.17 to 3.88)), and holmium laser enucleation (1.07 (0.07 to 2.08)). The worst performing method was diode laser vapourisation (-1.90 (-5.07 to 1.27)). The results of IPSS at 12 months after treatment were similar to Qmax at 12 months after treatment. The best three methods, versus monopolar TURP, were diode laser enucleation (mean difference -1.00 (-2.41 to 0.40)), bipolar enucleation (0.87 (-1.80 to 0.07)), and holmium laser enucleation (-0.84 (-1.51 to 0.58)). The worst performing method was diode laser vapourisation (1.30 (-1.16 to 3.76)). Eight new methods were better at controlling bleeding than monopolar TURP, resulting in a shorter catheterisation duration, reduced postoperative haemoglobin declination, fewer clot retention events, and lower blood transfusion rate. However, short term transient urinary incontinence might still be a concern for enucleation methods, compared with resection methods (odds ratio 1.92, 1.39 to 2.65). No substantial inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence was detected in primary or secondary outcomes.\nCONCLUSION:\nEight new endoscopic surgical methods for benign prostatic hyperplasia appeared to be superior in safety compared with monopolar TURP.

Since conventional pharmacotherapy for LUTS/BPH can lead to sexual side effects, herbal therapies are widely used as complementary and alternative treatments worldwide. HT080 is an herbal extract of Cinnamomum cassia and Rosa Laevigata, both of which have been used to treat symptoms typically associated with BPH in traditional Asian medicine. The aims of this trial are to assess whether HT080 can alleviate LUTS/BPH in middle-aged and elderly men, and to investigate the safety of HT080.\nMETHODS/DESIGN:\nA double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-arm parallel group trial will be conducted in men with moderate LUTS/BPH. A total of 100 eligible men aged 40 to 75 years with an International Prostate Symptom Score of 8 to 19 will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio and receive either HT080 (500 mg) or placebo twice a day for 12 weeks. All participants will be evaluated for efficacy and safety at baseline and weeks 6 and 12. The primary endpoint is the change in International Prostate Symptom Score between baseline and week 12. The secondary efficacy variables are uroflowmetry parameters (maximal urinary flow rate and post-void residual volume), serum prostate-specific antigen, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone levels, the International Index of Erectile Function score, and participant-reported global response assessment scores. The safety assessments include adverse events, laboratory tests results, vital signs, and physical examination.\nDISCUSSION:\nThis is a first-in human trial designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of HT080 among middle-aged and elderly men with LUTS/BPH.

This study was attempted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of modified two-lobe technique versus traditional three-lobe technique of HoLEP focusing mainly on incidences of retrograde ejaculation (RE) and urinary incontinence (UI).\nMETHODS:\nFrom March 2014 to February 2017, 191 men with BPH were randomly assigned to two groups: 97 underwent modified two-lobe technique; 94 underwent traditional three-lobe technique. All patients were followed up for 12 months. Primary outcomes were incidences of RE and UI, and secondary outcomes were international prostate symptom score (IPSS), quality of life (QOL), maximal urine flowing rate (MFR), and residual urine among the studied patients.\nRESULTS:\nCompared with the traditional technique, patients in the modified group had a statistically significant decrease in frequency of UI (1.03% vs 8.51%, p=0.036) and RE in the 6th month (33.33% vs 63.64%, p=0.030) and 12th month (13.33% vs 50%, p=0.034) and a significant increase in ejaculatory volume in the 6th month (p=0.050) and 12th month (p=0.003).

Followup consisted of 3-month clinic visits and prostate specific antigen testing in year 1 with prostate specific antigen measurement every 6 to 12 months and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging with biopsy for magnetic resonance imaging suspicious for recurrence. Treatment failure was considered any secondary treatment, tumor recurrence with Gleason 3 + 4 or greater disease on prostate biopsy without further treatment or metastasis and/or prostate cancer related mortality. To diagnose failure we evaluated a series of nadir + x thresholds with x values of 0.1 to 2.0 ng/ml.\nRESULTS:\nMedian patient age was 65 years (IQR 60-71) and the median Gleason score was 7 (range 6-9). Gleason 3 + 4 or greater disease was present in 80% of cases. Tumors were radiologically staged as T1c-T2c in 522 of the 596 patients (88%) and as T3a/b in 74 (12.4%).

Elevated prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) based on transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) measurements has been shown to be strongly associated with clinically significant disease and to predict progression on active surveillance (AS) for men with disease that is at a low stage or grade. We hypothesized that elevated MRI PSAD is similarly associated with increased risk of progression on subsequent biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS. In this retrospective study, men with Gleason score of 3+3 on diagnostic TRUS-guided biopsy who were managed with AS, had undergone MRI, and had at least one additional biopsy were included. MRI PSAD was calculated using prostate volume on MRI and prostate-specific antigen level temporally closest to the MRI. Multivariable logistics regression models were used to evaluate the association between MRI PSAD and predictors of upgrade on serial biopsy. RESULTS. A total of 166 patients were identified, of whom 74 (44.6%) were upgraded to a Gleason score of 7 or higher on subsequent biopsy. Lesions with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scores of 4 and 5 more commonly had MRI PSAD of 0.15 ng/mL2 or higher (51.93% vs 22.22%, p = 0.01) than lesions with PI-RADS scores of 1-3. Median MRI PSAD was significantly higher in the upgraded group compared with the group that was not upgraded (0.15 ng/mL2 vs 0.11 ng/mL2, p = 0.01). MRI PSAD was significantly associated with increased odds of upgrading on subsequent biopsy (log transformation; odds ratio, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.2-2.8]; p = 0.01) after adjusting for age and length of follow-up. CONCLUSION. MRI PSAD was significantly associated with Gleason score upgrading on subsequent biopsy for men initially diagnosed with Gleason 3+3 disease.

Cost-effectiveness analyses were conducted with individual-level data on health-care costs from comprehensive registers and register data on real-world effectiveness from the two arms of the Finnish Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (FinRSPC), following 80,149 men from 1996 through 2015. The study examines cost-effectiveness in terms of overall mortality and, in addition, in terms of diagnosed men's mortality from prostate cancer and mortality with but not from prostate cancer. Neither arm of the FinRSPC was clearly more cost-effective in analysis in terms of overall mortality. Organised screening in the FinRSPC could be considered cost-effective in terms of deaths from prostate cancer: averting just over one death per 1000 men screened. However, even with an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of below 20,000€ per death avoided, this result should not be considered in isolation.

PSA levels in serum correlate with disease progression, though its diagnostic accuracy is questionable. As a result, significant progress has been made in developing modified PSA tests such as PSA velocity, PSA density, 4Kscore, PSA glycoprofiling, Prostate Health Index, and the STHLM3 test. PSA, a serine protease, is secreted from the epithelial cells of the prostate. PSA has been suggested as a molecular target for prostate cancer therapy due to the fact that it is not only active in prostate tissue but also has a pivotal role on prostate cancer signaling pathways including proliferation, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, apoptosis, immune response, and tumor microenvironment regulation. Here, we summarize the current standing of PSA in prostate cancer progression as well as its utility in prostate cancer therapeutic approaches with an emphasis on the role of PSA in the tumor microenvironment.", "publication": "Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2019 Sep;38(3):333-346. doi: 10.1007/s10555-019-09815-3.", "topic": "Prostate Cancer Screening", "authors": ["Moradi A", "Srinivasan S", "Clements J", "Batra J"], "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s10555-019-09815-3"}, {"references": null, "title": "Update of the Standard Operating Procedure on the Use of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for the Diagnosis, Staging and Management of Prostate Cancer.", "abstract": "Abstract\nPURPOSE:\nWe update the prior standard operating procedure for magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate, and summarize the available data about the technique and clinical use for the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer. This update includes practical recommendations on the use of magnetic resonance imaging for screening, diagnosis, staging, treatment and surveillance of prostate cancer.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\nA panel of clinicians from the American Urological Association and Society of Abdominal Radiology with expertise in the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer evaluated the current published literature on the use and technique of magnetic resonance imaging for this disease. When adequate studies were available for analysis, recommendations were made on the basis of data and when adequate studies were not available, recommendations were made on the basis of expert consensus.\nRESULTS:\nProstate magnetic resonance imaging should be performed according to technical specifications and standards, and interpreted according to standard reporting. Data support its use in men with a previous negative biopsy and ongoing concerns about increased risk of prostate cancer. Sufficient data now exist to support the recommendation of magnetic resonance imaging before prostate biopsy in all men who have no history of biopsy. Currently, the evidence is insufficient to recommend magnetic resonance imaging for screening, staging or surveillance of prostate cancer.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nUse of prostate magnetic resonance imaging in the risk stratification, diagnosis and treatment pathway of men with prostate cancer is expanding.

However, there are controversies about the use of PSA as a population screening test because of the high potential for overdiagnosis and overtreatment associated. The net benefit of screening is unclear and according to the available recommendations, it should be offered to well-informed men with an adequate health status and a life-expectancy of at least 10 years or to men at elevated risk of having PCa. In addition, the factors that influence test results are unclear, as is impact of false positive or negative results on patient health.Our objective is to assess the clinical and analytical factors associated with the presence of false positive and false negative results and the diagnostic/therapeutic process followed by these patients.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS:\nA prospective observational cohort study will be carried out. We will include a cohort of patients with a positive PSA result (1.081 patients) and a sample of patients with negative results (572 patients); both will be followed for 2 years by reviewing medical records to assess the variables associated with these results, as well as characteristics of patient management after a positive PSA value. We will include those patients with a PSA determination from 2 hospitals in the Valencian Community. Patients who have been previously diagnosed with prostate cancer or who are being followed for previous high PSA values will be excluded.\nDISCUSSION:\nThe study will estimate the frequency of false positive and false negative PSA results in routine clinical practice, and allow us to quantify the potential harm caused.\nSTUDY REGISTRATION:\nClinicaltrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/): NCT03978299, June 7, 2019.", "publication": "Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Oct;98(40):e17451. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000017451.", "topic": "Prostate Cancer Screening", "authors": ["Bernal-Soriano MC", "Parker LA", "López-Garrigos M", "Hernández-Aguado I", "Caballero-Romeu JP", "Gómez-Pérez L", "Alfayate-Guerra R", "Pastor-Valero M", "García N", "Lumbreras B"], "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6783167/"}, {"references": null, "title": "The Role of Prostate Specific Antigen Monitoring after Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate.", "abstract": "Abstract\nPURPOSE:\nProstate specific antigen screening for prostate cancer has recently been challenged due to poor sensitivity. In addition to prostate cancer, a number of conditions elevate prostate specific antigen, of which benign prostatic hyperplasia is most common. The objective of this study was to assess the positive predictive value of prostate specific antigen and prostate specific antigen density for prostate cancer risk following holmium laser enucleation of the prostate.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\nWe queried an institutional review board approved database of holmium laser enucleation of the prostate performed at Indiana University from 1999 to 2018 to identify 1,147 patients with prostate specific antigen data available after holmium laser enucleation. A total of 55 biopsies after enucleation were recorded. Demographics, prostate specific antigen, prostate volume and oncologic details were analyzed. The primary outcome was biopsy proven prostate cancer.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 55 patients underwent transrectal ultrasound prostate biopsy for cause after holmium laser enucleation of the prostate. Cancer was identified in more than 90% of biopsied cases. Men with prostate specific antigen above 1 ng/ml at biopsy had a 94% probability of cancer detection and an 80% risk of clinically significant disease. Prostate specific antigen density above 0.1 ng/ml2 was associated with a 95% risk of cancer and an 88% risk of clinically significant cancer. Prostate specific antigen greater than 5.8 ng/ml or prostate specific antigen density greater than 0.17 ng/ml2 was universally associated with biopsy proven cancer.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nProstate specific antigen and prostate specific antigen density have high positive predictive value for prostate cancer risk after holmium laser enucleation of the prostate. Thresholds for biopsy should be lower than in patients who do not undergo holmium laser enucleation. Those who undergo that procedure and have prostate specific antigen above 1 ng/ml or prostate specific antigen density above 0.1 ng/ml2 are at higher risk for harboring clinically significant disease and should undergo biopsy.

We sought to quantify these competing risks using the probability that the cancer was over diagnosed, ie would not have been clinically diagnosed (diagnosed without screening) during the remaining lifetime of the patient.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\nUsing an established model of prostate cancer screening and clinical diagnosis we simulated screen detected cases and determined whether a modeled clinical diagnosis would occur before noncancer death. Time of noncancer death was based on comorbidity adjusted population lifetables. Logistic regression models were fitted to the simulated data and used to estimate over diagnosis probabilities given patient age, prostate specific antigen level, Gleason sum and comorbidity category. An online calculator was developed to communicate over diagnosis estimates. Face validity and ease of use were assessed by surveying 32 clinical experts.\nRESULTS:\nEstimated probabilities of over diagnosis ranged from 4% to 78% across clinicopathological variables and comorbidity status. When ignoring comorbidity, the estimated probability of over diagnosis in a 70-year-old man with prostate specific antigen 9.4 ng/ml and Gleason 6 was 34%. With severe comorbidities the estimate increased to 51%. Such a personalization may help inform the choice between active surveillance and definitive treatment. Based on responses from 20 of 32 experts we modified the explanation of over diagnosis for the online calculator and the input method for comorbid conditions.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThe probability of over diagnosis is strongly influenced by comorbidity status in addition to age.

Clinical management of advanced disease is lacking in standardized recommendations due to the rarity of the disease. To date, complete and extensive surgery represents the only curative and standardized approach for localized disease, while the impact of retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy and adjuvant treatments on clinical outcomes are still unclear. Similarly, a standardized systemic treatment for advanced metastatic disease is still missing. Cases Presentation: Four out of 274 patients have been identified in our sarcoma population. The mean age was 54 years (range = 45-73). The histotypes showed liposarcoma in 2 cases and leiomyosarcoma in the remaining 2 cases. In all 4 cases, the disease was localized at presentation, patients underwent complete surgery, and no adjuvant treatments were done. Three cases presented a recurrence of disease at a mean follow-up of 86 months (range = 60-106 months), more than 7 years. Two cases were treated with a second surgery and chemotherapy and 1 case only with chemotherapy. Discussion and Conclusions: Sharing data about clinical management of paratesticular mesenchymal tumors is a key issue due to the rarity of this tumor's subtype.

They bind to and activate two main cannabinoid receptors type 1 (CB1) and type 2 (CB2), and together with their metabolizing enzymes form the \"endocannabinoid system\" (ECS). In the last years, the relevance of endocannabinoids (eCBs) as critical modulators in various aspects of male reproduction has been pointed out. Mammalian male germ cells, from mitotic to haploid stage, have a complete ECS which is modulated during spermatogenesis. Compelling evidence indicate that in the testis an appropriate \"eCBs tone\", associated to a balanced CB receptors signaling, is critical for spermatogenesis and for the formation of mature and fertilizing spermatozoa. Any alteration of this system negatively affects male reproduction, from germ cell differentiation to sperm functions, and might have also an impact on testicular tumours. Indeed, most of testicular tumours develop during early germ-cell development in which a maturation arrest is thought to be the first key event leading to malignant transformation. Considering the ever-growing number and complexity of the data on ECS, this review focuses on the role of cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 signaling in male germ cells development from gonocyte up to mature spermatozoa and in the induction of epigenetic alterations in these cells which might be transmitted to the progeny. Furthermore, we present new evidence on their relevance in testicular cancer.", "publication": "Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Dec 18;21(1). pii: E25. doi: 10.3390/ijms21010025.", "topic": "Testicular Cancer", "authors": ["Barchi M", "Innocenzi E", "Giannattasio T", "Dolci S", "Rossi P", "Grimaldi P"], "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6981618/"}, {"references": null, "title": "Risk Factors and Treatment Outcomes of 1,375 Patients with Testicular Leydig Cell Tumors: Analysis of Published Case Series Data.", "abstract": "Abstract\nPURPOSE:\nLeydig cell tumors are rare but they are the most common nongerm cell testicular tumors. Only limited evidence exists for reliably differentiating between benign and malignant Leydig cell tumors and for optimally managing the different types and stages of this rare disease. In this review we synthesize the available evidence on the clinical presentation and clinicopathological characteristics associated with Leydig cell tumor malignancy and management.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\nWe analyzed published case series data on Leydig cell tumors. The association between clinicopathological variables and the presence of metastatic disease was assessed using regression analyses.\nRESULTS:\nWe included 357 reports, reviewing available data from 1,375 patients (median age 34 years). Testis sparing surgery was performed in 463 patients. Local recurrence after testis sparing surgery occurred in 8 of 121 (7%) patients with available followup information. Metastases were found in 101 patients and were most often located in the retroperitoneal lymph nodes (60%), lungs (38%) and/or liver (29%). The multivariable models with or without multiple imputation predicting metastatic disease included older age, larger tumor size, presence of any adverse factor (larger tumor diameter, necrosis, angiolymphatic invasion, pleomorphism, high mitotic index, atypia) and any protective factor (Reinke crystals, lipofuscin pigments, gynecomastia) with model AUCs of 0.93. Durable remission after resection of metastases or use of platinum based chemotherapy was rarely seen.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nOur risk tables using clinicopathological parameters can help identify patients with malignant tumors.

FOXP3+ and PD-1+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) expressing CD68 and CD163 were enumerated. PDL-1 expression was evaluated on tumor cells and macrophages.\nRESULTS:\nGCTs primarily express PD-L1 on TAMs, except choriocarcinoma, where true tumor cell positivity was noted. Seminomas reveal increased intratumoral PD-L1+ TAMs compared with NSGCTs (P < .05). Activated TILs are increased in NM-seminomas compared with M-seminomas (P < .05).

We analyzed and reviewed our case series regarding GTS that developed after the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) nongerminoatous germ cell tumors (NGGCTs).\nMETHODS:\nOur institutional review board approved this retrospective study. Between 2003 and 2018, we treated 16 patients (16 males; age ranging from 5.4 to 51.9 years, median 13.8) with CNS-NGGCT at our institution. We reviewed those patients and also reviewed the literature about GTS of CNS. We defined primary GTS (p-GTS) as the enlargement of cyst size and/or solid tumor occurred during treatment in the absence of marker elevation, and recurrent GTS (r-GTS) as the enlargement of teratoma after complete response of initial tumors.\nRESULTS:\nAmong 16 patients with CNS-NGGCT, we surgically confirmed mature/immature teratoma components in 15 patients. Two patients underwent surgical removal of tumor before neoadjuvant therapy, and among the rest 14 patients, 6 developed p-GTS, and 2 patients underwent salvage surgery during chemo-/chemoradiotherapy. Those with histologic diagnosis of immature teratoma during salvage surgery had a shorter interval from the initiation of chemoradiotherapy compared with mature teratoma (P < 0.05). One patient developed r-GTS. In the literature review, most of the p-GTS consisted of enlargement with the multicystic component. Histologic diagnosis of immature teratoma during salvage surgery was observed in earlier stages of chemoradiotherapy (P < 0.05, log-rank test). Previous history of p-GTS might be a risk factor of r-GTS.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThe incidence of p-GTS, enlargement of the cystic component during treatment, is not rare.

Low testosterone in cancer survivors can be due to orchidectomy or effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. We have undertaken a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-month trial of testosterone replacement in young male cancer survivors with borderline low testosterone (7-12 nmol/l).\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS:\nThis was a multicentre United Kingdom study conducted in secondary care hospital outpatients. Male survivors of testicular cancer, lymphoma, and leukaemia aged 25-50 years with morning total serum testosterone 7-12 nmol/l were recruited. A total of 136 men were randomised between July 2012 and February 2015 (42.6% aged 25-37 years, 57.4% 38-50 years, 88% testicular cancer, 10% lymphoma, matched for body mass index [BMI]). Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive testosterone (Tostran 2% gel) or placebo for 26 weeks. A dose titration was performed after 2 weeks. The coprimary end points were trunk fat mass and SF36 Physical Functioning score (SF36-PF) at 26 weeks by intention to treat. At 26 weeks, testosterone treatment compared with placebo was associated with decreased trunk fat mass (-0.9 kg, 95% CI -1.6 to -0.3, p = 0.0073), decreased whole-body fat mass (-1.8 kg, 95% CI -2.9 to -0.7, p = 0.0016), and increased lean body mass (1.5 kg, 95% CI 0.9-2.1, p < 0.001). Decrease in fat mass was greatest in those with a high truncal fat mass at baseline. There was no treatment effect on SF36-PF or any other QoL scores. Testosterone treatment was well tolerated. The limitations of our study were as follows: a relatively short duration of treatment, only three cancer groups included, and no hard end point data such as cardiovascular events.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nIn young male cancer survivors with low-normal morning total serum testosterone, replacement with testosterone is associated with an improvement in body composition.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION:\nISRCTN: 70274195, EudraCT: 2011-000677-31.", "publication": "PLoS Med. 2019 Nov 12;16(11):e1002960. doi: 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002960. eCollection 2019 Nov.", "topic": "Testicular Cancer", "authors": ["Walsh JS", "Marshall H", "Smith IL", "Greenfield DM", "Swain J", "Best E", "Ashton J", "Brown JM", "Huddart R", "Coleman RE", "Snowden JA", "Ross RJ"], "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6850530/"}, {"references": null, "title": "Abdominal cocoon with bilateral cryptorchidism and seminoma in the right testis: a case report and review of literature.", "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nAbdominal cocoon is a rare peritoneal lesion and is difficult to diagnose because of its lack of special clinical manifestations.

Testicular tumors were confirmed by pathology and classified as seminoma (n = 20) or NSGCT (n = 19). Two radiologists analyzed the testicular tumors on preoperative MRI for morphology: multiple nodules or a single mass; presence/absence of a capsule; signal compared to the normal contralateral testicle (isointense, hypointense, hyperintense, or mixed); enhancement; septa; and hemorrhagic or cystic degeneration. Characteristics of seminomas and NSGCT were compared using the Chi-square or Fischer exact test.MRI showed that the majority (95%; 19/20) of seminomas were nodular. There were significant differences in the presence/absence of a capsule (P = .001), T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) signal intensity (P = .047), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) signal intensity (P < .001), septa (P < .001), and hemorrhagic or cystic degeneration (P < .001) between seminomas and NSGCT.Seminomas were more likely to have no capsule, isointensity on T1WI, hypointensity on T2WI, and had narrow obviously enhanced fibrovascular septa without hemorrhagic or cystic degeneration; NSGCT was more likely to have a capsule, a mainly mixed signal on T1WI and T2WI, most of them had no fibrovascular septa, and hemorrhagic or cystic degeneration was common in malignant NSGCT.This study suggests that preoperative MRI can distinguish seminoma from NSGCT.

Disruption of ubiquitin-proteasomal proteolysis, impaired molecular-level components of the blood-testis barrier, and impaired regulatory action of TGF-β on the cell cycle can play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of male infertility and the initiation of carcinogenesis in the testis. The effect of low doses of ionizing radiation as an additional etiological factor leads to changes in the structural, as well as molecular, components of the testis, including epigenetic changes, which can be characterized as environmental pathomorphosis, which leads to impaired spermatogenesis and increased risk of malignancy. Summarizing the literature review data, we can state that patients with blocked spermatogenesis, in which atypical germ cell neoplasia in situ cells are detected in testicular tissue, constitute a group at increased risk of testicular carcinogenesis. The presence of additional etiological factors, such as chronic low doses of ionizing radiation, can initiate the progression of carcinogenesis in the testicle.", "publication": "Exp Oncol. 2019 Sep;41(3):224-234.", "topic": "Testicular Cancer", "authors": ["Bazalytska SV", "Persidsky Y", "Romanenko AM"], "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.32471/exp-oncology.2312-8852.vol-41-no-3.13527"}, {"references": null, "title": "MRI findings of an atypical testicular epidermoid cyst: A case report.", "abstract": "Abstract\nINTRODUCTION:\nTypical testicular epidermoid cysts (TECs) manifestate as a target sign or onion skin sign on ultrasonography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Clinicians are increasingly aware of the imaging characteristics of typical TECs, which allow accurate diagnosis and successful treatment while preserving the testicle, but atypical TECs are likely to be misdiagnosed as a malignant intratesticular neoplasm, leading to complete testicular resection.\nPATIENT CONCERNS:\nA 26 year-old male patient complained of a painless enlargement of the left testicle that had been present for 1 month. The patient had no recent medical history of scrotal trauma or systemic infection.\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA round 48 mm × 45 mm × 43 mm mass was seen inside the left testicle. T2-weighted images of the lesion showed a thin hypointense capsule. T1-weighted images of the lesion showed a hyperintense nodule on the cyst wall, which appeared hypointense on T2-weighted and SPAIR images. After Gd-DTPA injection, the lesion was not enhanced; however, the nodule was enhanced on THRIVE images. These manifestations were consistent with a benign intratesticular lesion, and MR imaging diagnosed atypical TEC, which was confirmed by pathology after surgery.\nINTERVENTIONS:\nThe patient was treated with organ-sparing surgery with testicular enucleation.\nOUTCOMES:\nThe patient was re-examined with ultrasonography 3 months after surgery.

To our knowledge no randomized, controlled trials of onabotulinum toxin A for chronic scrotal pain management have been reported to date.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\nIn this double-blind, randomized, controlled trial men with chronic scrotal pain who achieved at least temporary pain relief following a cord block with local anesthesia were randomly assigned to a block using local anesthesia alone vs local anesthesia plus 200 IU onabotulinum toxin A. Standardized assessments of pain levels using a visual analogue score, disease impact, quality of life and mood were performed 1, 2, 3, 4, 12 and 18 weeks after injection.

This review focuses on the most up-to-date guideline for evaluation of pituitary function among men presenting with signs and symptoms of hypogonadism.\nRECENT FINDINGS:\nThe clinician must differentiate between primary (testicular) and secondary (pituitary-hypothalamic or central) hypogonadisms and be aware of adult-onset hypogonadism. If gonadotropins are low or inappropriately normal, the clinician must consider potential reversible causes in the hypothalamus-pituitary axis. Also, it is critical to understand the pitfalls of testosterone testing. When clinically indicated, evaluation of other pituitary hormone functions as well as pituitary magnetic resonance imaging may be necessary. Furthermore, it is essential to recognize that pituitary incidentalomas are common. Patients with microprolactinoma are more likely to present with symptoms of sexual dysfunction while those with macroprolactinoma are more likely to present with symptoms of mass effect. Some functional pituitary tumors respond to drug therapy while other nonfunctional tumors require surgical intervention.

The latter specifically relates to the germ cells present being at risk when blocked in an embryonic stage of development. GGCC originates from either germ cell neoplasia in situ (testicular environment) or gonadoblastoma (ovarian-like environment). These precursors are characterized by presence of the markers OCT3/4 (POU5F1), SOX17, NANOG, as well as TSPY, and cKIT and its ligand KITLG.

Their central role in energy metabolism is currently accepted. More recently, their involvement in fertility regulation and the development of some reproductive disorders has been suggested. Data concerning the role of leptin and adiponectin, the two most studied adipokines, in the control of the reproductive axis are consistent. In recent years, interest has grown about some novel adipokines, chemerin, visfatin, resistin and apelin, which have been found to be strongly associated with obesity and insulin-resistance. Here, we will review their expression and role in male and female reproduction in humans and animal models. According to accumulating evidence, they could regulate the secretion of GnRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone), gonadotropins and steroids. Furthermore, their expression and that of their receptors (if known), has been demonstrated in the human and animal hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis. Like leptin and adiponectin, these novel adipokines could thus represent metabolic sensors that are able to regulate reproductive functions according to energy balance changes.

A mosaic form of trisomy 20, in which only some cells or tissues contain the extra chromosome, is a relatively commonly encountered chromosomal abnormality found during prenatal testing, and c. 90% result in a normal phenotype. However, despite the absence of a consistent phenotype, certain findings have been reported across multiple cases of mosaic trisomy 20. These include an array of morphological findings, developmental delays, and learning disabilities. Beyond physical manifestations, a wide range of developmental and learning delays have also been reported.

Two reviewers independently will judge the methodological quality of studies included in the meta-analysis using the criteria reported in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions or the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale according to the design of the trials. The meta-analysis will be performed using random effects models and heterogeneity will be assessed using Higgins I2 value. Summary estimate of the proportion of each outcome will be expressed as pooled proportion with 95% confidence interval (CI). The effect of the day on each outcome will be evaluated using a multilevel mixed-effects model with a moderator (the day). The effect will be expressed as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). A P value less than .05 will be considered statistically significant.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION:\nThis is a systematic review not requiring an ethical approval.

Clinical history, breast cancer risk factors, imaging and pathology results were gathered from the electronic medical record.\nRESULTS:\nThe study included 80 women. Mean patient age was 37 years (range 34-39 years). Sixty-seven (84%) had negative or benign screening (BI-RADS 1 or 2) and 13 (16%) were recalled for diagnostic imaging (BI-RADS 0). Four of 13 (31%) recalled women were given BI-RADS 1 or 2 at diagnostic work-up, 4 (31%) were given a BI-RADS 3, and 5 (38%) were recommended for biopsy (BI-RADS 4).

Yet such studies were focused on MS from relatively marginalized cultures, namely either from non-Western developing countries or minority groups in developed countries. The current study sheds light on possible cultural influences of the dominant culture on medical students in two developed countries, potentially with different dominant cultures regarding reprogenetics and reproductive risks: Israel and Croatia.\nMETHODS:\nQuantitative-statistical analyses were employed, based on anonymous questionnaires completed by 150 first year medical students in Israel and Croatia. The questionnaires pertained to the knowledge and attitudes regarding genetics, reproduction and reproductive risks. These questionnaires were completed before the students were engaged in learning about these topics as part of the curriculum in their medical school.\nRESULTS:\nSubstantial differences were revealed between the two groups of medical students. Israeli medical students were less tolerant regarding reproductive risks and more knowledgeable about genetics and reproductive risks than Croatian medical students. For example, while nearly all Israeli medical students (96%) disagreed with the idea that \"Screening for reproductive risks in prospective parents is wrong,\" less than 40% of their Croatian counterparts shared a similar stance. Similarly, all (100%) Israeli medical students correctly observed that \"A carrier of a recessive genetic disease actually has the disease\" was wrong, as opposed to only 82% of Croatian students.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nBy linking applicable theoretical literature to these findings, we suggest that they may reflect the hidden influence of the dominant culture in each country, disguised as part of the \"culture of medicine.\" Acknowledging and learning about such influence of the dominant culture, may be an important addition to the training of medical students in cultural competence, and specifically their cultural awareness.

This article uses a political science concept, the idea of the \"democratic deficit\" to examine the lack of American public discourse on innovations in ART. In doing so, the article focuses on America's missing public consultation in health care innovation. This missing discourse is significant, as political and ethical considerations may impact regulatory decisions. Thus, to the extent that these considerations are influencing the decisions of federal agency employees, namely those who work within the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the public is unable to participate in the decision-making process. This lack of a public discourse undermines the goals of the administrative state, which include democratic participation, transparency, and accountability. The United Kingdom, on the other hand, has had a markedly divergent experience with assisted reproductive technology innovation. Instead of ignoring the various ethical, social, and legal issues surrounding assisted reproductive technology innovation, the United Kingdom engaged in a five-strand public consultation on the topic of mitochondrial transfer, a form of assisted reproductive technology that uses genetic modification in order to prevent disease transmission. This article argues that after a multi-decade standstill in terms of the public discourse related to ethical issues associated with assisted reproductive technology and germline modification, it is time for the United States to institute a more democratic inquiry into the scientific, ethical, and social implications of new forms of assisted reproductive technology and ultimately, forthcoming medical innovations that involve genetic modification.", "publication": "Am J Law Med. 2019 May;45(2-3):130-170. doi: 10.1177/0098858819860610.", "topic": "Assisted Reproductive Technology", "authors": ["Lewis MS"], "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/0098858819860610"}, {"references": null, "title": "Serum and follicular fluid thyroid hormone levels and assisted reproductive technology outcomes.", "abstract": "Abstract\nOBJECTIVE:\nThe objective ofthis study was to assess the association between thyroid hormone (TH) levels in follicular fluid (FF) and serum and to determine whether THs impact assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcomes.\nMETHODS:\nThis study enrolled 299 women undergoing ART.

The receptor for vitamin D regulates 0.5-5% of the human genome. Accordingly, vitamin D insufficiency has been shown to increase the risk of several diseases. In recent years, based on growing evidence, on a role of vitamin D has been also postulated in reproductive health both in animals and humans, especially in female fertility female fertility. In vitro fertilization success was shown to be higher in women with appropriate reserves of vitamin D. However a causal relation has not been demonstrated and randomized controlled trials testing the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation in IVF are warranted.\nMETHODS:\nThis is a multicenter randomized double blinded placebo controlled study aimed at determining the benefits of vitamin D [25(OH)D] supplementation in improving clinical pregnancy rate in women undergoing IVF. Eligible women with a serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] < 30 ng/ml will be randomized. Recruited women will be given the drug (either 600,000 IU of 25(OH) D or placebo in a single oral administration) at the time of randomization. Two centres will participate and the sample size (700 women) is foreseen to be equally distributed between the two. Patients will be treated according to standard IVF protocols.\nDISCUSSION:\nThe primary aim of the study is the cumulative clinical pregnancy rate per oocyte retrieval. Clinical pregnancy is defined as the presence of at least one intrauterine gestational sac with viable foetus at first ultrasound assessment (3 weeks after a positive human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG] assessment).

Each dataset is analyzed in reference to the respective country, so as to devise local incidence scores that are then juxtaposed in inter-country comparison.\nRESULTS:\nThe incidence of GS rises steeply in both countries. Though US surrogates are contracted by local and international, heterosexual and gay, and partnered and single intended parents, the relative incidence of GS is lower in the USA than in Israel, where only local heterosexual couples could contract a gestational surrogate. An exceptionally high rate of multiple births was observed in both settings, suggesting some overlooking of professional recommendations for elective single-embryo transfer.\nCONCLUSION:\nGS incidence appears to resemble the ratio between the countries' respective fertility rates.

That cohort of women may be exposed to a greater number of cardiac, obstetric and anesthesio-logical complications, therefore the incidence of medico-legal issues, litigation, liabilities and claims over the past years has significantly risen. Cardiovascular and hormonal changes during pregnancy can challenge even the healthiest of individuals, and in that pregnant population the risk is even greater. These patients should be monitored before the ART, during pregnancy, delivery and puerperium, to avoid heart failure, thrombotic problems, embolic complications, stroke and death. Management issues regarding pregnancy and delivery are elaborate, including anesthesia considerations. This new population of women needs an accurate cardiac risk stratification with a thorough cardiovascular history and examination, 12 lead ECG, and transthoracic echocardiogram. Therefore, a comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment and management can provide the best opportunity to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes.", "publication": "Clin Ter. 2019 Sep-Oct;170(5):e364-e367. doi: 10.7417/CT.2019.2161.", "topic": "Assisted Reproductive Technology", "authors": ["Baldini D", "Beck R", "Negro F", "De Viti D"], "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.7417/CT.2019.2161"}, {"references": null, "title": "Assisted reproductive technology and the risk of pediatric cancer: A population based study and a systematic review and meta analysis.", "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nThere is controversy whether exposure to assisted reproductive technology (ART) is associated with increased risk of pediatric cancer. We aimed at calculating the overall risk of pediatric cancers after ART in a large cohort of exposed women; and to conduct a systematic review and meta- analysis of cohort studies examining overall risk of pediatric cancers after ART.\nMETHODS:\nAll children born in Israel who were members of Maccabi Health Services (MHS) between 1999 and 2016 after ART, were linked to the Israeli Registry of Childhood Cancer (IGS) to identify those with cancer diagnosed before 16 years of age. In parallel we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational cohort studies with more than 5000 ART- exposed cases that measured pediatric cancer after ART.\nRESULTS:\nIn the cohort study, the risk ratio for pediatric cancer after ART in general was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.76-1.19). The RR was 1.09 (95% CI, 0.79-1.48) for IVF treatments.

To address unmet needs for contraception information and services, a community-based, gender-sensitive and culturally adapted brief counselling intervention (SIRIAN program) was launched in some deprived neighbourhoods with a high proportion of immigrants in Barcelona. Once a randomized controlled trial demonstrated its effectiveness in increasing the use of contraceptives, we aim to examine its population impact on adolescent fertility rates.\nMETHODS:\nQuasi-experimental study with comparison group, using population data from 2005 to 2016. Five neighbourhoods in the lowest tercile of Disposable Household Income were intervened in 2011-13. The comparison group included the three neighbourhoods which were in the same municipal district and in the lowest Disposable Household Income tercile, and displayed the highest adolescent fertility rates. Generalized linear models were fitted to assess absolute adolescent fertility rates and adjusted by immigrant population between pre-intervention (2005-10) and post-intervention periods (2011-16); Difference in Differences and relative pre-post changes analysis were performed.\nRESULTS:\nIn 2005-10 the intervention group adolescent fertility rate was 27.90 (per 1000 women 15-19) and 21.84 in the comparison group. In 2011-16 intervention areas experienced great declines (adolescent fertility rate change: - 12.30 (- 12.45 to - 12.21); p < 0.001), while comparison neighbourhoods remained unchanged (adolescent fertility rate change: 1.91 (- 2.25 to 6.07); p = 0.368). A reduction of - 10.97 points (- 13.91 to - 8.03); p < 0.001) is associated to the intervention.\nCONCLUSION:\nAdolescent fertility rate significantly declined in the intervention group but remained stable in the comparison group. This quasi-experimental study provide evidence that, in a country with universal health coverage, a community counselling intervention that increases access to contraception, knowledge and sexual health care in hard-to-reach segments of the population can contribute to substantially reduce adolescent fertility rates.

Although postpartum family planning (PPFP) is an increasingly high priority for many countries, uptake and need for PPFP varies in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to characterize postpartum contraceptive use, and predictors and barriers to use, among postpartum women in LMIC.\nMETHODS:\nPubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and Global Health databases were searched for articles and abstracts published between January 1997 and May 2018. Studies with data on contraceptive uptake through 12 months postpartum in low- and middle-income countries were included. We used random-effects models to compute pooled estimates and confidence intervals of modern contraceptive prevalence rates (mCPR), fertility intentions (birth spacing and birth limiting), and unmet need for contraception in the postpartum period.\nRESULTS:\nAmong 669 studies identified, 90 were selected for full-text review, and 35 met inclusion criteria. The majority of studies were from East Africa, West Africa, and South Asia/South East Asia. The overall pooled mCPR during the postpartum period across all regions was 41.2% (95% CI: 15.7-69.1%), with lower pooled mCPR in West Africa (36.3%; 95% CI: 27.0-45.5%). The pooled prevalence of unmet need was 48.5% (95% CI: 19.1-78.0%) across all regions, and highest in South Asia/South East Asia (59.4, 95% CI: 53.4-65.4%). Perceptions of low pregnancy risk due to breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhea were commonly associated with lack of contraceptive use and use of male condoms, withdrawal, and abstinence. Women who were not using contraception were also less likely to utilize maternal and child health (MCH) services and reside in urban settings, and be more likely to have a fear of method side effects and receive inadequate FP counseling. In contrast, women who received FP counseling in antenatal and/or postnatal care were more likely to use PPFP.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nPPFP use is low and unmet need for contraception following pregnancy in LMIC is high.

Thirteen distinct isoforms of AQPs have been identified in mammals (AQP0-12). Throughout the male reproductive tract, AQPs greatly enhance water transport across all biological barriers, providing a constant and expeditious movement of water and playing an active role in the regulation of water and ion homeostasis. This regulation of fluids is particularly important in the male reproductive tract, where proper fluid composition is directly linked with a healthy and competent spermatozoa production. For instance, in the testis, fluid regulation is essential for spermatogenesis and posterior spermatozoa transport into the epididymal ducts, while maintaining proper ionic conditions for their maturation and storage. Alterations in the expression pattern of AQPs or their dysfunction is linked with male subfertility/infertility. Thus, AQPs are important for male reproductive health. In this review, we will discuss the most recent data on the expression and function of the AQPs isoforms in the human, mouse and rat male reproductive tract.

This ethnographic study conducted in The Gambia, West Africa, focuses on how key stakeholders in the country understand infertility, and on their activities to improve the lives of people with infertility.\nMETHODOLOGY:\nThis ethnographic study draws on primary and secondary data for thematic analysis. Primary qualitative data were collected using in-depth interviews, observations, informal conversations and group discussion with various stakeholders (i.e. health care providers and representatives of non-governmental, governmental and international organisations). Sources of secondary data included government and non-governmental reports and media outputs.\nRESULTS:\nResults illustrated that most key stakeholders had a good understanding of the cultural frameworks and social realities of women living with infertility, with less focus on, or awareness of, men's experiences of infertility. We distinguished three different positions of these actors and organisations, first, the infertility supporters, i.e. those who despite political challenges and a lack of funding, initiated activities to raise awareness about the problems people with infertility are facing and aim to increase access to infertility services. The second are moderate supporters, i.e. those who recognise the problems infertility poses and whose organisations target some of the perceived causes of infertility (i.e. lack of health education and harmful cultural practices). A third group of neutral or moderate opponents consist mainly of formal health care providers who do not consider infertility a current priority, given many competing demands in the resource-constrained healthcare system.\nCONCLUSION:\nWhile international donors still largely neglect the emotional and social implications of infertility in Sub-Saharan African countries, some local stakeholders are working to bring services closer to people with infertility.

The receptor for vitamin D regulates 0.5-5% of the human genome. Accordingly, vitamin D insufficiency has been shown to increase the risk of several diseases. In recent years, based on growing evidence, on a role of vitamin D has been also postulated in reproductive health both in animals and humans, especially in female fertility female fertility. In vitro fertilization success was shown to be higher in women with appropriate reserves of vitamin D. However a causal relation has not been demonstrated and randomized controlled trials testing the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation in IVF are warranted.\nMETHODS:\nThis is a multicenter randomized double blinded placebo controlled study aimed at determining the benefits of vitamin D [25(OH)D] supplementation in improving clinical pregnancy rate in women undergoing IVF. Eligible women with a serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] < 30 ng/ml will be randomized. Recruited women will be given the drug (either 600,000 IU of 25(OH) D or placebo in a single oral administration) at the time of randomization. Two centres will participate and the sample size (700 women) is foreseen to be equally distributed between the two. Patients will be treated according to standard IVF protocols.\nDISCUSSION:\nThe primary aim of the study is the cumulative clinical pregnancy rate per oocyte retrieval. Clinical pregnancy is defined as the presence of at least one intrauterine gestational sac with viable foetus at first ultrasound assessment (3 weeks after a positive human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG] assessment). Secondary outcomes include: 1) clinical and embryological variables; 2) oocyte and endometrium quality at a molecular level.

Here, we present individual-level data from a large PCS program in which exome sequencing was routinely performed on either gamete donors (5,845) or infertile patients (8,280) undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment without any known family history of inheritable genetic conditions. Individual-level data on pathogenic variants were used to define conditions for PCS based on criteria for severity, penetrance, inheritance pattern, and age of onset. Fetal risk was defined based on actual carrier frequency data accounting for the specific inheritance pattern (fetal disease risk, FDR). In addition, large-scale application of exome sequencing for PCS allowed a deep investigation of the incidence of medically actionable secondary findings in this population. Exome sequencing achieved remarkable clinical sensitivity for reproductive risk of highly penetrant childhood-onset disorders (1/337 conceptions) through analysis of 114 selected gene-condition pairs. A significant contribution to fetal disease risk was observed for rare (carrier rate < 1:100) and X-linked conditions (16.7% and 41.2% of total FDR, respectively).

We described here clinical and histopathological characteristics of patients diagnosed between January 2009 and September 2017.Fifty-five patients with an average age of 55.4 years (range: 25-84 years) were analyzed, with 24.4 months being the average time between the onset of symptoms and start of treatment. Among patients without palpable lymph nodes at the first examination, 51% were affected by inguinal metastasis. In the multivariate analysis, the presence of angiolymphatic invasion (P = .029) and absence of koilocytosis (P = .001) were found to be predictive factors for lymph node metastasis.

However, the detection of HPV-DNA is not sufficient to consider it the etiological factor in the development of this type of cancer. Currently, the overexpression of P16INK4A is used as a surrogate biomarker of HPV carcinogenesis. Information on PeCa in Mexico is scarce, particularly regarding cases related to HPV and genotype frequency.\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo evaluate the presence of HPV, its genotypes, and the presence of multiple genotypes, and the expression of P16INK4A, as well as its clinical and histopathological parameters.\nMETHODS:\nFor HPV-DNA detection and P16INK4A expression, we used the INNO-LiPA® test and immunohistochemistry, respectively.\nRESULTS:\nSixty cases of PeCa were evaluated, of which 75% were HPV-non-related histological variants. We found that 58.9% (33/56) of PeCa cases were HPV-DNA positive, while 30.9% of the cases evaluated (17/55) were positive for P16INK4A. HPV16 was the main genotype in 42.9% of the cases, followed by HPV52 in 7.1% and HPV18 in 5.4%. Within the HPV-positive cases, 27.3% had multiple genotypes. All HPV-positive patients under the age of 45 years were positive only for HPV16.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nHPV16 was the most commonly detected genotype in PeCa. HPV 31, 35 and 39 were infrequent; however, they were related to a single infection and P16INK4A overexpression; thus, they seem to be relevant in PeCa carcinogenesis. Our results suggest that P16INK4A overexpression could be useful for the classification of HPV-related PeCa. The role of multiple HPV genotypes in the development and prognosis of PeCa is still not completely understood. Thus, it is necessary to define criteria to establish reliable ways to classify HPV-related PeCa that could lead to optimal therapeutic approaches.", "publication": "BMC Infect Dis. 2019 Dec 19;19(1):1068. doi: 10.1186/s12879-019-4696-6.", "topic": "Penis Disorders", "authors": ["Martínez-Bailón C", "Mantilla-Morales A", "Méndez-Matías G", "Alvarado-Cabrero I", "Maldonado-Rodríguez R", "Quintero-Becerra J", "Arias-Flores R", "Piña-Sánchez P"], "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6924036/"}, {"references": null, "title": "Prognosis of the 8th TNM Staging System for Penile Cancer and Refinement of Prognostication by Incorporating High Risk Human Papillomavirus Status.", "abstract": "Abstract\nPURPOSE:\nWe evaluated the prognostic value of the 8th TNM staging system and assessed a modified N stage incorporating high risk human papillomavirus status in a multicenter cohort.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\nIncluded in analysis were 292 patients with M0 penile squamous cell carcinoma from a total of 6 referral centers.

Penile cancer is a rare but aggressive cancer. Several case reports have recently been published that indicate that AABP may increase the risk of penile cancer.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\nA retrospective review was conducted of adults diagnosed with AABP and penile cancer between January, 2008 and December, 2018 seen at a tertiary referral center. Demographics including age, BMI, comorbidities, etiology of AABP, smoking history, circumcision status, and premalignant lesions (condyloma, lichen sclerosus [LS] carcinoma in situ [CIS]) were recorded. For patients with penile cancer, AJCC staging, grade, TNM staging and treatments were recorded. Basic descriptive statistics were performed for the overall cohort. We used Chi-square tests and Fisher exact tests to compare differences between patients with benign pathology and patients with malignant or pre-malignant pathology.\nRESULTS:\nWe identified 150 patients with the diagnosis of AABP. The prevalence of penile squamous cell carcinoma was 7%. There was a 35% rate of premalignant lesions. This study is limited by its retrospective and single-institution nature.\nCONCLUSION:\nAABP is a condition that incorporates multiple risk factors for penile cancer. The prevalence of penile cancer appears to be higher in patients with AABP; however, more data are needed to confirm these initial findings. Patients with AABP should be counseled on these risks and should be considered for buried penis repair if a physical examination cannot be performed.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this article we describe in detail the glans resurfacing technique with skin graft for penile cancer in a video presentation and we review the current knowledge of the literature.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS:\nThe procedure is described in a stepwise fashion. Initially the patient is circumcised. The glans is marked in quadrants and completely stripped by dissecting and removing the epithelium and subepithelium layer of the glans. Deep spongiosal biopsies are taken to exclude invasion. Each quadrant is sent separately for biopsy. The surface of the graft size needed is estimated. A partial thickness skin graft is harvested from the thigh with a dermatome. The skin graft is then fenestrated. The graft is rolled over the glans and quilted with multiple sutures. A silicone 16F Foley catheter and a suprapubic catheter are placed. The penis is dressed with multiple gauzes and compressed with an elastic band.\nRESULTS:\nThe patient is discharged the next day. The dressing and Foley catheter are removed in 7 days. The patient continues to use the suprapubic catheter for 7 more days. The patient refrains from any sexual activity for 6 weeks and is closely followed.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nGlans resurfacing is an emerging new appealing surgical technique that is already a recommendation in the EAU guidelines for the treatment of premalignant and superficial penile lesions.

Tissue specimens of cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile and anal cancer diagnosed in 2012-2018 were retrieved from three cancer referral hospitals and tested for high-risk (HR) HPV DNA. Cervical cancer represented the majority of cases (598 of 738), of which 96.0% were HR-HPV positive. HPV-attributable fractions in other cancer sites varied from 53.1% in 81 penile, through 76.7% in 30 vulvar, 83.3% in 24 vaginal, up to 100% in 5 anal cases. HPV16 was the predominant HR-HPV type in cervical cancer (55.0%), followed by HPV18 (16.6%) and HPV45 (13.4%). HPV16 also predominated in other cancer sites (60-80% of HR-HPV-attributable fraction). For cervical cancer, type-specific prevalence varied significantly by histology (higher alpha-9 type prevalence in 509 squamous cell carcinoma vs. higher alpha-7 type prevalence in 80 adenocarcinoma), but not between 501 HIV-negative and 97 HIV-positive cases.

The intravaginal ejaculatory laten-cy time (IELT) before treatment, fourth and eighth weeks after treatment was recorded by the patient's wife with a stopwatch.\nRESULTS:\nMean IELT before, 4 and 8 weeks after treatment in four groups were: sertraline 69.4±54.3, 353.5±190.4, 376.3±143.5; fluoxetine 75.5±64.3, 255.4±168.2, 314.8±190.4; paroxeti-ne 71.5±69.1, 320.7±198.3, 379.9±154.3; citalopram 90.39±79.3, 279.9±192.1, 282.5±171.1 seconds, respectively. The ejaculation time significantly increased in all groups (p <0.05), but there was no significant difference between the groups (P=0.75). Also, there was no significant difference in drugs side effects between groups (p >0.05). The most common side effects were drowsiness and dyspepsia, which were not severe enough to cause discontinuation of the drug.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nAll available SSRIs were effective and usually had no serious complications. In patients who did not respond to any of these drugs, other SSRI drugs could be used as a salvage therapy.\nCopyright® by the International Brazilian Journal of Urology.", "publication": "Int Braz J Urol. 2019 Nov-Dec;45(6):1209-1215. doi: 10.1590/S1677-5538.IBJU.2019.0121.", "topic": "Sexual Problems in Men", "authors": ["Siroosbakht S", "Rezakhaniha S", "Rezakhaniha B"], "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1590/S1677-5538.IBJU.2019.0121"}, {"references": null, "title": "Progresses in pharmaceutical and surgical management of premature ejaculation.", "abstract": "Abstract\nOBJECTIVE:\nPremature ejaculation (PE) is regarded as one of the most common male sexual dysfunctions.

This study aimed to examine a cohort of adolescents from a single centre to investigate whether there were any clinically significant changes in BMD and bone mineral apparent density (BMAD) whilst on GnRHa therapy. Methods A retrospective review of 70 subjects aged 12-14 years, referred to a national centre for the management of GD (2011-2016) who had yearly dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. BMAD scores were calculated from available data. Two analyses were performed, a complete longitudinal analysis (n=31) where patients had scans over a 2-year treatment period, and a larger cohort over the first treatment year (n=70) to extend the observation of rapid changes in lumbar spine BMD when puberty is blocked. Results At baseline transboys had lower BMD measures than transgirls. Although there was a significant fall in hip and lumbar spine BMD and lumbar spine BMAD Z-scores, there was no significant change in the absolute values of hip or spine BMD or lumbar spine BMAD after 1 year on GnRHa and a lower fall in BMD/BMAD Z-scores in the longitudinal group in the second year.

However, rates of sexual dysfunction ofup to 50% have been described after TME, and rates of urinary dysfunction of up to 30%. Although other factors are involved, the main cause of postoperative genitourinary dysfunction is intraoperative injury to the pelvic autonomic nerves. The risk is particularly high in the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). The aim of this study is to compare pre- and post-TME sexual dysfunction, depending on the surgical approach usedin the inferior mesenteric vessels: either directly on the IMA, or from the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) to the IMA.\nMETHODS:\nProspective, randomized,controlled study of patients with rectal adenocarcinoma with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, who will be randomly assigned to one of two groups depending on the surgical approach to the inferior mesenteric vessels.

Numerous studies have shown the involvement of inflammatory processes in this pathological condition. Sexual intercourse requires healthy and functioning vessels to supply the pelvic region in both males and females, generating penile erection and clitoral and vaginal lubrication, respectively. Cardiovascular diseases and associated risk factors may contribute negatively to pelvic blood flow, possibly through immune system activation.\nAIM:\nThe study aimed to address the correlation between vascular inflammation driven by immune system activation and SD in males and females.\nMETHODS:\nA literature review was performed to identify articles addressing male and female SD and vascular inflammation. Key words included \"male and female sexual dysfunction,\" \"vascular inflammation,\" \"iliac and pudendal arteries dysfunction,\" \"genitourinary tract,\" and \"blood flow.\"\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:\nManagement of systemic and local inflammation may be a useful alternative to improve SD and reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases in the future.\nRESULTS:\nIncreased levels of cytokines and chemokines have been detected in humans and animals with hypertension, obesity, and diabetic conditions. Chronic activation of the innate immune system, especially by pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns, and metabolic-related disorders may act as triggers further contributing to an increased inflammatory condition. Due to the reduced size of vessels, SD and retinal vascular impairments have been shown to be predictive factors for cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, considering that blood flow to the genitalia is essential for sexual function, endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling, secondary to chronic immune system activation, may be implicated in male and female vasculogenic SD.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nSeveral conditions appear to play a role in SD. In the present review, we have identified a role for the immune system in generating vascular and tissue impairments contributing to erectile dysfunction and female SD.

In this article we report anecdotal cases of severe complications following penile surgery for ED and PD in high volume centers, describe the strategies adopted to treat it and discuss the options that would have helped preventing these events.\nPATIENTS' CONCERNS:\nThe first case describes a patient with history of ED and PD causing penile shortening and a slight dorsal deviation of penile shaft. In the second case it is described a corporeal necrosis and urethral fistula following inflatable penile prosthesis implant. In the last case it is described the migration of reservoir into the abdomen after inflatable penile prosthesis implantation post-radical prostatectomy.\nDIAGNOSIS:\nAll 3 patients were investigated with a penile doppler ultrasound with PGE1 intracorporeal injection for ED and PD diagnosis. An abdominal computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging were ordered for patient of case three.\nINTERVENTIONS:\nThe patients underwent different combined procedures depending on the case and including: glansectomy, penile prosthesis implantation associated with a penile elongation with double dorsal-ventral patch graft (\"sliding technique\"), penile urethroplasty with buccal mucosa graft, and laparotomy for reservoir removal.\nOUTCOMES:\nNo further serious complications were reported after the procedures described.\nLESSONS:\nPenile surgery in patients with concomitant PD and systemic comorbidities can be at high risk of complications.

Ejaculatory hood sparing vaporization was performed with preservation of the paracollicular and supracollicular tissue proximal to the verumontanum in 25 patients. Patients were assessed at baseline, and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively using the Ej-MSHQ (Ejaculatory Domain of Male Sexual Health Questionnaire) and the IIEF-15 (International Index of Erectile Function-15). The I-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Score), uroflowmetry and post-void residual urine volume were reported at each followup visit. A standard urodynamic study was performed at 6 months.\nRESULTS:\nAntegrade ejaculation was reported in 85% and 31.6% of patients after hood sparing and standard prostate vaporization, respectively (p=0.001). A significant reduction in the EJ-MSHQ score was reported after standard vaporization at 6 and 12 months (each p <0.001) with no significant difference after hood sparing vaporization (p=0.18 and 0.078, respectively). The median EJ-MSHQ score was 28.5 (range 1 to 33) and 27 (range 1 to 33) for hood sparing vaporization, and 9.5 (range 1 to 35) and 9 (range 0 to 33) for standard vaporization at 6 (p=0.005) and 12 months (p <0.001), respectively. Each group showed a decline in the mean total IIEF-15 score at 1 year but it was statistically significant only after standard vaporization (p=0.001). All urinary outcome measures revealed comparable significant improvement at all followups. Postoperative urodynamic assessment demonstrated a significant comparable decrease in the Bladder Outlet Obstruction Index from a median of 64 (range 21 to 207) to 23.5 (range 10 to 53) after hood sparing vaporization (p=0.005) and from 87 (range 38 to 186) to 19.5 (range 7 to 51) after standard vaporization (p=0.001).

In 2018, there were 9,006 clinical isolates of gonococci from public and private sector sources tested for in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility by standardised methods. This was the highest annual total of isolates tested since the inception of the AGSP. The current treatment recommendation for gonorrhoea, for the majority of Australia, remains dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value ≥0.06 mg/L) was found nationally in 1.73% of isolates. The highest proportions were reported from Tasmania and non-remote Western Australia (7.3% and 2.1% respectively). In 2018 two extensively drug-resistant isolates were reported from Queensland patients. These two isolates, with ceftriaxone MIC values of 0.50 mg/L, high-level resistance to azithromycin (MIC ≥ 256 mg/L), and resistance to penicillin and ciprofloxacin were identified and reported to the World Health Organization as isolates of international significance. Resistance to azithromycin (MIC value ≥1.0 mg/L) was found nationally in 6.2% of isolates, lower than the 9.3% reported in 2017, but more than double the proportion reported in 2015 (2.6%). The highest proportions were reported from the Australian Capital Territory (8.7%), Victoria (8.3%), and New South Wales (6.5%). High-level resistance to azithromycin (MIC value ≥256 mg/L) was reported in nine isolates nationally in 2018: four from New South Wales, three from Victoria, and two from Queensland. The proportion of isolates resistant to penicillin in non-remote Australia ranged from 8.8% in non-remote Northern Territory to 44.1% in South Australia. In remote Northern Territory penicillin resistance rates remain low (1.9%), and higher in remote Western Australia (6.5%). The proportion of isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin in non-remote Australia ranged from 10.3% in non-remote Northern Territory to 48.3% in South Australia.

STI are often extragenital and asymptomatic. Both can delay diagnosis and treatment. Approval of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) might have influenced sexual behaviour and STI-prevalence of HIV- MSM. We estimated STI-prevalence and risk factors amongst HIV- and HIV+ MSM in Germany to plan effective interventions.\nMETHODS:\nWe conducted a nationwide, cross-sectional study between February and July 2018. Thirteen MSM-friendly STI-practices screened MSM for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Mycoplasma genitalium (MG), Neisseria gonorrhea (NG), and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) using self-collected rectal and pharyngeal swabs, and urine samples. APTIMA™ STI-assays (Hologic™ Inc., San Diego, USA) were used for diagnostics, and samples were not pooled. We collected information on socio-demographics, HIV-status, clinical symptoms, sexual behaviour within the last 6 months, and PrEP use. We combined HIV status and PrEP use for defining risk groups, and used directed acyclic graphs and multivariable logistic regression to identify risk factors for STI.\nRESULTS:\nTwo thousand three hundred three MSM were included: 50.5% HIV+, median age 39 [18-79] years. Median number of male sex partners within the last 6 months was five. Sex without condom was reported by 73.6%, use of party drugs by 44.6%. 80.3% had a STI history, 32.2% of STI+ MSM reported STI-related symptoms. 27.6% of HIV- MSM used PrEP. Overall STI-prevalence was 30.1, 25.0% in HIV-/PrEP- MSM (CT:7.2%; MG:14.2%; NG:7.4%; TV:0%), 40.3% in HIV-/PrEP+ MSM (CT:13.8%; MG:19.4%; NG:14.8%; TV:0.4%), and 30.8% in HIV+ MSM (CT:10.1%; MG:18.4%; NG:8.6%; TV:0.1%). Being HIV+ (OR 1.7, 95%-CI 1.3-2.2), using PrEP (OR 2.0, 95%-CI 1.5-2.7), having > 5 sex partners (OR:1.65; 95%-CI:1.32-2.01.9), having condomless sex (OR:2.11.9; 95%-CI:1.65-2.86), and using party drugs (OR:1.65; 95%-CI:1.32-2.0) were independent risk factors for being tested positive for at least one STI.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nWe found a high STI-prevalence in MSM in Germany, especially in PrEP users, frequently being asymptomatic. As a relevant proportion of PrEP users will not use a condom, counselling and comprehensive STI screening is essential and should be low threshold and preferably free of cost. Counselling of PrEP users should also address use of party drugs.", "publication": "BMC Infect Dis. 2020 Feb 7;20(1):110. doi: 10.1186/s12879-020-4831-4.", "topic": "Gonorrhea", "authors": ["Jansen K", "Steffen G", "Potthoff A", "Schuppe AK", "Beer D", "Jessen H", "Scholten S", "Spornraft-Ragaller P", "Bremer V", "Tiemann C", "MSM Screening Study group"], "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7007644/"}, {"references": null, "title": "Prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae co-infections among patients with newly diagnosed syphilis: a single-centre, cross-sectional study.", "abstract": "Abstract\nOBJECTIVES:\nThe aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae co-infections among patients with newly diagnosed syphilis.\nMETHODS:\nIn patients with any stage of newly diagnosed syphilis swabs were performed from urethra, rectum, pharynx and cervix according to the gender and type of sexual intercourse. From these smears standard validated nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections were done.\nRESULTS:\nFrom 548 (488 men, 60 women) screened patients co-infection was detected in 15.9% of the cases. The majority of the co-infections (86.2%) were asymptomatic. The overall prevalence of chlamydial infection was 11.1% and 8.8% for gonococcal infections. In men who have sex with men (MSM) the prevalence of co-infections was significantly higher (20.0%) than in heterosexual men and women (4.2%) (p < 0.001). In MSM patients the presence of co-infection was significantly associated with HIV infection (p < 0.001).

However, the mechanisms underlying sexually transmitted infections in women and the link between the infection mechanism and the wide range of clinical outcomes remain elusive due to a lack of research models mimicking human infection in vivo. We established a human cervical tissue explant model to mimic local Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) infections. We found that GC preferentially colonize the ectocervix by activating integrin-β1, which inhibits epithelial shedding. GC selectively penetrate into the squamocolumnar junction (TZ) and endocervical epithelia by inducing β-catenin phosphorylation, which leads to E-cadherin junction disassembly. Epithelial cells in various cervical regions differentially express carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs), the host receptor for GC opacity-associated proteins (OpaCEA). Relatively high levels were detected on the luminal membrane of ecto/endocervical epithelial cells but very low levels intracellularly in TZ epithelial cells. CEACAM-OpaCEA interaction increased ecto/endocervical colonization and reduced endocervical penetration by increasing integrin-β1 activation and inhibiting β-catenin phosphorylation respectively, through CEACAM downstream signaling. Thus, the intrinsic properties of cervical epithelial cells and phase-variation of bacterial surface molecules both play a role in controlling GC infection mechanisms and infectivity, preferential colonization or penetration, potentially leading to asymptomatic or symptomatic infection.", "publication": "PLoS Pathog. 2019 Dec 2;15(12):e1008136. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1008136. eCollection 2019 Dec.", "topic": "Gonorrhea", "authors": ["Yu Q", "Wang LC", "Di Benigno S", "Gray-Owen SD", "Stein DC", "Song W"], "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6907876/"}, {"references": null, "title": "Incidence and Imminence of Pregnancy in At-Risk Teens After Emergency Department Visits.", "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nInterventions aimed at reducing teen pregnancy rates in the United States have focused on clinics and schools.

MtrD resembles the homologous Escherichia coli AcrB efflux protein with several common structural features, including an open cleft containing putative access and deep binding pockets proposed to interact with substrates. A highly discriminating N. gonorrhoeae strain, with the MtrD and NorM multidrug efflux pumps inactivated, was constructed and used to confirm and extend the substrate profile of MtrD to include 14 new compounds. The structural basis of substrate interactions with MtrD was interrogated by a combination of long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations and docking studies together with site-directed mutagenesis of selected residues. Of the MtrD mutants generated, only one (S611A) retained a wild-type (WT) resistance profile, while others (F136A, F176A, I605A, F610A, F612C, and F623C) showed reduced resistance to different antimicrobial compounds. Docking studies of eight MtrD substrates confirmed that many of the mutated residues play important nonspecific roles in binding to these substrates. Long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations of MtrD with its substrate progesterone showed the spontaneous binding of the substrate to the access pocket of the binding cleft and its subsequent penetration into the deep binding pocket, allowing the permeation pathway for a substrate through this important resistance mechanism to be identified. These findings provide a detailed picture of the interaction of MtrD with substrates that can be used as a basis for rational antibiotic and inhibitor design.IMPORTANCE With over 78 million new infections globally each year, gonorrhea remains a frustratingly common infection. Continuous development and spread of antimicrobial-resistant strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of gonorrhea, have posed a serious threat to public health. One of the mechanisms in N. gonorrhoeae involved in resistance to multiple drugs is performed by the MtrD multidrug resistance efflux pump. This study demonstrated that the MtrD pump has a broader substrate specificity than previously proposed and identified a cluster of residues important for drug binding and translocation. Additionally, a permeation pathway for the MtrD substrate progesterone actively moving through the protein was determined, revealing key interactions within the putative MtrD drug binding pockets. Identification of functionally important residues and substrate-protein interactions of the MtrD protein is crucial to develop future strategies for the treatment of multidrug-resistant gonorrhea.\nCopyright © 2019 Chitsaz et al.", "publication": "mBio. 2019 Nov 19;10(6). pii: e02277-19. doi: 10.1128/mBio.02277-19.", "topic": "Gonorrhea", "authors": ["Chitsaz M", "Booth L", "Blyth MT", "O'Mara ML", "Brown MH"], "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6867893/"}, {"references": null, "title": "Epidemiology, molecular characterisation and antimicrobial susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates in Madrid, Spain, in 2016.", "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the aim to elucidate gonococcal antimicrobial resistance (AMR)-risk factors, we undertook a retrospective analysis of the molecular epidemiology and AMR of 104 Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates from clinical samples (urethra, rectum, pharynx and cervix) of 94 individuals attending a sexually transmitted infection clinic in Madrid (Spain) from July to October 2016, and explored potential links with socio-demographic, behavioural and clinical factors of patients. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by E-tests, and isolates were characterised by N. gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing. Penicillin resistance was recorded for 15.4% of isolates, and most were susceptible to tetracycline, cefixime and azithromycin; a high incidence of ciprofloxacin resistance (~40%) was found. Isolates were grouped into 51 different sequence types (STs) and 10 genogroups (G), with G2400, ST5441, ST2318, ST12547 and G2992 being the most prevalent. A significant association (P = 0.015) was evident between HIV-positive MSM individuals and having a ciprofloxacin-resistant strain.

Couples (n = 2370; men aged ≥18 years and women aged 18-45 years) planning infertility treatment were enrolled at 4 US reproductive endocrinology and infertility care study centers between June 2013 and December 2017.
