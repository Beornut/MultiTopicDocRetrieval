While fall prevention strategies have been historically championed by nurses, hospitalist physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants play a vital role in the multidisciplinary care team in ensuring the safety of our patients. Multiple fall risk assessment tools exist, but no one tool has demonstrated excellence in predicting patient falls in the hospital. Any fall risk assessment tool should be complemented by a clinician's individualized evaluation of patient-specific, situational, and environmental risk factors. A particular emphasis on medication review is critical, as numerous medication classes can increase the risk of falls, and medications are a potentially modifiable risk factor. Multiple studies of individual and multicomponent nursing-based interventions have failed to demonstrate success in reducing falls or fall injuries. Promising strategies for fall prevention include tailoring interventions to patient risk factors and individualized patient education. In addition to nursing-based interventions, the hospitalist's role in fall prevention is to (1) identify and address potentially modifiable risk factors, (2) reinforce individualized education to patients, and (3) advise behavior choices that promote safe mobility. If a patient does sustain a fall, the hospitalist should partner with the multidisciplinary care team in post fall care to assess for injury, evaluate underlying causes of the fall, and determine plans for secondary prevention.", "authors": ["Keuseman R", "Miller D"], "title": "A hospitalist's role in preventing patient falls."}, {"references": null, "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.4088/JCP.TV18059BR2C", "publication": "J Clin Psychiatry. 2020 Jan 28;81(2). pii: TV18059BR2C. doi: 10.4088/JCP.TV18059BR2C.", "topic": "Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage", "abstract": "Abstract\nValbenazine and deutetrabenazine are FDA-approved as treatment for tardive dyskinesia (TD).

Multiple healthcare and service providers are often involved in care, which can result in increased risk of fragmentation of care. Optimal medication therapy management (MTM) is essential to ensure therapeutic benefit from medication regimens. However, little is known about the experiences of providers in supporting persons with SCI/D with MTM.\nMETHODS:\nTelephone interviews were conducted to explore healthcare and service providers' experiences with MTM for persons with SCI/D. Participants were recruited through clinical organizations and researchers' personal contacts. Participants were purposefully selected for diversity in profession and were required to be English speaking and to have provided care to at least one person with SCI/D. The qualitative interviews followed a semi-structured interview guide. Data display matrices were used in a constant comparative process for descriptive and interpretive analysis.\nRESULTS:\nThirty-two interviews were conducted from April to December 2018. Each profession had distinct views on their roles in facilitating MTM for persons with SCI/D, which aligned with their respective scopes of practice. Shared provider tasks included tailoring medications, providing education, and exploring medication alternatives. Most participants felt that the care they provided for persons with SCI/D was similar to the care that they provided to other patients, with some differences relating to the physical limitations and medical complexity associated with SCI/D. Five factors were identified that impacted participants' abilities to provide MTM for persons with SCI/D: patient self-management skills, provider knowledge and confidence, provider-patient relationships, interprofessional collaboration, and provider funding models including the use of technology-supported consultations.\nCONCLUSION:\nWhile participants described commonalities in the barriers and enablers associated with providing MTM to persons with SCI/D and other populations, there were unique considerations identified. These SCI/D-specific considerations resulted in recommendations for improvements in MTM for this population.

To expand access to care for rural-dwelling patients with epilepsy, a national nonprofit organization initiated an integrated, interprofessional telehealth program.\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo identify gaps in care based on a telepharmacist's recommendations and determine whether these recommendations aligned with Health Effectiveness Data Information Set (HEDIS) performance measures.\nMETHODS:\nA retrospective chart review was conducted for patients who had an appointment with an integrated interprofessional care team composed of an epileptologist, a social worker, registered nurses, and a pharmacist. This novel approach integrated provision of care by team members at geographically distinct remote locations. The pharmacist conducted comprehensive medical reviews via video conferencing and made recommendations to the epileptologist, primary care provider, and/or patient, as appropriate. The consultation was documented in the electronic health record (EHR). The pharmacist's recommendations were categorized as 1 of the 24 preselected HEDIS performance measures or as a non-HEDIS measure.

The majority of patients were female (52%), with a mean age of 26.2 years (SD = 14.6, range 4-76) and were taking an average of 6.1 medications (SD = 3.6). 159 comorbidities or conditions were identified in the EHR along with 306 recommendations, for an average of 3.6 recommendations per patient (SD = 3.2). 41 (13.4%) recommendations aligned with preselected HEDIS measures, including medication management for depression (31.7%), hypertension (24.4%), asthma (9.8%), and comprehensive adult diabetes care (14.6%). The remaining 265 recommendations lacked sufficient documentation for categorization or failed to align with any targeted measure.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThis retrospective analysis showed that only 13% of pharmacist recommendations aligned with HEDIS quality measures.

Drug cost sharing can be a barrier to adherence, especially for low-income individuals with chronic conditions. Most of the existing studies in a Medicaid population have evaluated the effects of increasing drug copayments, but few studies have evaluated the effects of reducing drug copayments on medication adherence. Medicaid coverage for low-income childless adults in Wisconsin was expanded on April 1, 2014, which included reductions in drug copayments and monthly caps on out-of-pocket spending.\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo evaluate changes in adherence to oral diabetes medications using proportion of days covered (PDC) among Medicaid childless adults with type 2 diabetes after the 2014 Medicaid drug copayment reduction.\nMETHODS:\nA difference-in-differences design was used to compare the changes in medication adherence between childless adults (treatment group) and parents/caretakers (control group). Wisconsin Medicaid's administrative enrollment records, pharmacy claims, and medical claims data were analyzed. Medication adherence was evaluated for 4 commonly used oral diabetes drug classes (i.e., biguanides, sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones) by adapting the medication adherence quality measures endorsed by the Pharmacy Quality Alliance. The PDC for all diabetes drugs was calculated among patients who filled ≥ 2 prescriptions for any of the 4 drug classes. PDC for each drug class was also measured among patients who had ≥ 2 drug fills for each drug class. The proportion of adherent patients was evaluated using a threshold of PDC ≥ 0.80.\nRESULTS:\nAverage PDC for all diabetes drugs was 0.87 in the childless adults at baseline and significantly increased by 0.02 (P = 0.025) relative to the parents/caretakers after the copayment reduction. The baseline proportion of adherent patients (PDC ≥ 0.80) among the childless adults was 76% and significantly increased by 6.2 percentage points (P = 0.003) relative to the control group. The odds of adherence to oral antidiabetic drugs increased by 47%, resulting in the proportion of adherent patients in the childless adults group reaching almost 80% after the coverage expansion. In the per class analyses, a significant effect was found for biguanides; the proportion of adherent patients increased by 5.5 percentage points in childless adults compared with the control group (P = 0.022).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThis program evaluation found that a reduction of drug copayments in Wisconsin Medicaid improved the quality of medication use by increasing adherence to oral antidiabetic drugs among childless adults.\nDISCLOSURES:\nThis study was conducted as part of a larger study funded by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services.

We used multivariable regression to estimate the association of each measure with county-level demographics and health service measures.\nRESULTS:\nA 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in the proportion of African Americans living in a county is associated with a 0.096 SD decrease in adequacy of supply (βAS = -0.096; 95% CI = -0.14 to -0.06).

Such variation more likely reflects predisposing and enabling factors potentially affected by social, economic, and public health policy.

This necessitates a comprehensive review and assessment of their accuracy in identifying nonadherent patients.\nOBJECTIVES:\nTo (a) compare administrative claims-based measures of adherence with nonadherence verified by patient interview; (b) determine if and to what extent patients classified as nonadherent based on prescription claims differ from patients classified as nonadherent based on interventions designed to gather multiple types of medication lists to compare against the prescription fill history; and (c) assess the various patient-reported reasons for nonadherence.\nMETHODS:\nA cross-sectional study was used to identify patients from the Southern Piedmont Community Care Network of North Carolina who were enrolled with Medicaid between January 1, 2012, and May 31, 2013, and were using prescription medications for 1 or more chronic conditions. Patients with more than a 30-day gap in refill history were identified using prescription claims and were interviewed by pharmacists to assess the reasons for nonadherence. Based on the patient-reported reasons for a gap in refill, patients were classified as interview-verified nonadherent patients or interview-verified adherent patients. The positive predictive value of prescription claims in identifying nonadherent patients was calculated, and descriptive statistics were reported. Characteristics of interview-verified nonadherent patients were compared with adherent patients using t-tests and chi-square statistics.\nRESULTS:\n1,425 patients representing 2,936 patient-class of medication combinations were included in the final analysis. 824 (28.07%) of the 2,936 records that were flagged as nonadherent using claims analysis were confirmed as adherent during patient interviews. The positive predictive value of claims records in identifying nonadherent patients was 0.72. The 2 most common reasons for patients to be misclassified as nonadherent in claims data following self-report were discontinuation of medication on prescribers' directions (21.93%) and having an alternate channel for receiving the medication (6.13%). Among interview-verified nonadherent patients, side effects, patient beliefs, education, and socioeconomic barriers were the most common patient-reported reasons for gaps in refill.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nPrescription claims may underestimate adherence in patients. When interviewed directly by a pharmacist, most patients reported discontinuation of medication as per prescribers' directions. To determine the overall validity of prescription claims data, further analysis is required to assess its accuracy in identifying truly nonadherent patients among those who are identified as nonadherent by claims data.\nDISCLOSURES:\nNo outside funding supported this study.

The survey was hosted on GEDEFO's website during  March and April 2017. Activity data for 2016 was collected. Results: A total of 95 hospitals responded to the survey. Out of which, 76% had an integrated information system of  pharmacotherapeutic process management, where a variability in  technological and organizational processes were found. The  oncohematological pharmacist led the implementation of the principles  of medicine, based on evidence and results obtained in routine clinical  practice. It was shown that 88% of hospitals had standardized  protocols. As for safety practices, in 83% of hospitals,  oncohematological pharmacists actively participated in the development  and maintenance of risk management program, implemented to prevent  errors. Preparation was centralized in 89% of hospitals. Variability was observed in pharmaceutical care depending on  where the patient was attended.

Previous publications investigating the effects of physical activity (PA) on medical costs have made use of small sample sizes. We assessed the relationship between PA and 1-year medical expenditure among Taiwanese patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).Data were recruited from three governmental databases, including the 2012 adult preventive health service database.

Patients were stratified according to age and Charlson score. Multivariate linear regression models were used to determine β-coefficients and their P values.Overall, 218,960 individuals were identified with diabetes. The prevalence of the disease was 13.1% among sufficiently active, 35% among insufficiently active, and 51.9% among physically inactive adults. In general, patients who had exercise >150 minutes/week had lower health care spending (i.e., US$ 755.83) followed by those who had less than 150 minutes/week (US$ 880.08) when compared with inactive patients (P < .0001).

Accelerometer data were based on measurements obtained during a 7-day period at baseline.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:\nThe primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs), mortality rates, and 95% CIs were estimated using cubic splines and quartile classifications adjusting for age; sex; race/ethnicity; education; diet; smoking status; body mass index; self-reported health; mobility limitations; and diagnoses of diabetes, stroke, heart disease, heart failure, cancer, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 4840 participants (mean age, 56.8 years; 2435 [54%] women; 1732 [36%] individuals with obesity) wore accelerometers for a mean of 5.7 days for a mean of 14.4 hours per day.

The BNAT score and its components were compared with ECOG Performance Status scores assigned by oncologists and analyzed for correlation and agreement.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 103 male and female individuals (ages 33-87 years) with various cancer diagnoses participated. The mean (SD) ECOG Performance Status score was 0.95 (0.87), range 0 to 3, and the mean BNAT score was 14.9 (4.3), range 5 to 24. Spearman agreement association of BNAT and ECOG Performance Status scores revealed a significant moderate negative relationship (r = -0.568).\nLIMITATIONS:\nThe BNAT was compared with the ECOG Performance Status, a commonly used but subjective measure. Additionally, a common data set was used for both deriving and evaluating the BNAT performance scale.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThere was a moderate negative linear relationship of BNAT to ECOG Performance Status scores across all participants. Utilization of the BNAT may reflect overall physical performance and provide comprehensive and meaningful detail to influence therapeutic decisions.\n© 2020 American Physical Therapy Association.", "authors": ["Quinn SE", "Crandell CE", "Blake ME", "Bontrager AM", "Dempsey AG", "Lewis DJ", "Hamm JT", "Flynn JM", "Smith GS", "Wingard CJ"], "title": "The Correlative Strength of Objective Physical Assessment Against the ECOG Performance Status Assessment in Individuals Diagnosed With Cancer."}, {"references": null, "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/ptj/pzz177", "publication": "Phys Ther. 2020 Mar 10;100(3):438-446. doi: 10.1093/ptj/pzz177.", "topic": "Exercise for Older Adults", "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nSurvivors of breast cancer commonly report functional limitations, including cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and decreased aerobic capacity.

Self-reported upper extremity function using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire and shoulder range of motion, strength, and muscular endurance were measured. Participants were divided into 3 groups: breast cancer involving the nondominant limb (BC-ND), breast cancer involving the dominant limb (BC-DOM), and CTRL.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 59 women in the CTRL group, 23 women in the BC-ND group, and 28 women in the BC-DOM group completed measures. Mean DASH scores in women with breast cancer were higher than those of women in the CTRL group, regardless of the limb on which cancer occurred (Cohen d = 1.13; 95% CI = 2.20 to 16.21) Range of motion for the BC-ND group was significantly less for flexion (Cohen d = 1.19, 95% CI = -13.08 to -0.11) and external rotation (Cohen d = 1.11, 95% CI = -18.62 to -1.98) compared with the CTRL group. Strength in the BC-ND group was 23% to 25% lower in the CTRL group for external (Cohen's d = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.09 to 0.12) and internal rotation (Cohen d = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.13).

The range of post-surgical treatment times was broad, making it difficult to determine when function returned. Muscular endurance measures demonstrated a ceiling effect and large variance, limiting the ability to distinguish differences among participants. These results may not be generalizable to the subset of women who were treated with lumpectomy, sentinel node biopsy, or chest wall radiation alone or who underwent a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy.\nCONCLUSION:\nIn the long term, women with breast cancer have lower self-reported shoulder function than women without breast cancer.

Since whole body vibration (WBV) is known to efficiently stimulate the neuromuscular system and enhance cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength in frail individuals, we hypothesized that WBV would maintain various physical and psychological capacities in patients during alloHCT. Seventy-one patients were randomly allocated to either an intervention group (IG) doing WBV or an active control group (CG) doing mobilization exercises five times per week. We determined peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) and maximum power, maximum strength, functional performance, body composition, quality of life (QoL), and fatigue. Tests were carried out before conditioning therapy, at hospital discharge and at day ± 180 (follow-up). As 18 patients did not participate in post-intervention assessment and follow-up data from 9 patients was not collectible, per-protocol (PP) analysis of 44 patients is presented. During hospitalization, WBV maintained maximum strength, height, and power output during jumping, as well as reported QoL, physical functioning, and fatigue level compared with mobilization. At follow-up, relative VO2peak (p = 0.035) and maximum power (p = 0.011), time and power performing chair-rising test (p = 0.022; p = 0.009), and reported physical functioning (p = 0.035) significantly increased in the IG, while fatigue decreased (p = 0.005). CG's body cell mass and phase angle had significantly decreased at follow-up (p = 0.002; p = 0.004).

There is an urgent need for interventions. The study aimed to determine the effect of high-intensity resistance training (HI-RT), a time- and cost-efficient training modality, on sarcopenia in osteosarcopenic (OS) older men.\nMETHODS:\nForty-three community-dwelling men aged ≥72 years from Northern Bavaria, Germany, with OS were randomly assigned to either an active HI-RT group (HI-RT) or an inactive control group (CG). Both received dietary protein (up to 1.5 g/kg/day in HI-RT and 1.2 g/kg/day in CG) and Vitamin-D (up to 800 IE/d) supplements. The HI-RT was applied as a consistently supervised single-set training on resistance exercise machines using intensifying strategies, with two training sessions/week, structured into three phases (ranging from 8 to 12 weeks) totaling 28 weeks. The primary study endpoint was the Sarcopenia Z-score; secondary endpoints were changes in the underlying physiological parameters, skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), handgrip-strength and gait velocity.\nRESULTS:\nThe results show a significant effect of the exercise intervention on the sarcopenia Z-score in the HI-RT (p<0.001) and a significant worsening of it in the CG (p=0.012) in the intention-to-treat analysis, as well as a significant intergroup change (p<0.001). Analysis upon the underlying parameters showed a significant increase of skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) in the HI-RT group (p<0.001) and a significant intergroup difference of SMI (p<0.001) and handgrip strength (p<0.001). There were no adverse effects related to dietary supplementation or training.\nCONCLUSION:\nThe results clearly confirm the favorable effects of HI-RT on sarcopenia.

Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured using peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), oxygen uptake at the anaerobic threshold (VO2@AT), and maximal power output from cardiopulmonary exercise testing on a bicycle ergometer. Magnetic resonance imaging brain data were analyzed by voxel-based morphometry using regression models with adjustment for age, sex, education, smoking, body weight, systolic blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin level, and intracranial volume.\nRESULTS:\nVolumetric analyses revealed associations of CRF with gray matter (GM) volume and total brain volume. After multivariable adjustment, a 1-standard deviation increase in VO2peak was related to a 5.31 cm³ (95% CI, 3.27 to 7.35 cm³) higher GM volume. Whole-brain voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed significant positive relations between CRF and local GM volumes. The VO2peak was strongly associated with GM volume of the left middle temporal gyrus (228 voxels), the right hippocampal gyrus (146 voxels), the left orbitofrontal cortex (348 voxels), and the bilateral cingulate cortex (68 and 43 voxels).\nCONCLUSION:\nCardiorespiratory fitness was positively associated with GM volume, total brain volume, and specific GM and white matter clusters in brain areas not primarily involved in movement processing.

Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) enables more precise ocular incisions and lens fragmentation than does phacoemulsification cataract surgery (PCS). We hypothesised that FLACS might improve outcomes in cataract surgery compared with PCS despite having higher costs.\nMETHODS:\nWe did a participant-masked randomised superiority clinical trial comparing FLACS and PCS in two parallel groups (permuted block randomisation stratified on centres via a centralised web-based application, allocation ratio 1:1, block size of 2 or 4 for unilateral cases and 2 or 6 for bilateral cases). Five French University Hospitals enrolled consecutive patients aged 22 years or older who were eligible for unilateral or bilateral cataract surgery. Participants, outcome assessors, and technicians carrying out examinations were masked to the surgical treatment allocation until the last follow-up visit and a sham laser procedure was set up for participants randomly assigned to the PCS arm. The primary clinical endpoint was the success rate of surgery, defined as a composite of four outcomes at a 3-month postoperative visit: absence of severe perioperative complication, a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 0·0 LogMAR (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) or better, an absolute refractive error of 0·75 dioptres or less, and unchanged postoperative corneal astigmatism power (≤0·5 dioptres) and axis (≤20°). The primary economic endpoint was the incremental cost per additional patient who had treatment success at 3 months. Primary outcomes were assessed in all randomly assigned patients who met all eligibility criteria (missing data considered as failure). We used mixed logistic regression models or mixed linear regression models for statistical comparisons, adjusted on centres and whether cataract surgery was bilateral or unilateral.

We identified no significant difference in the success rate of surgery between the FLACS and PCS groups (FLACS: 41·1% [289 eyes]; PCS: 43·6% [299 eyes]); adjusted odds ratio 0·85, 95% CI 0·64-1·12, p=0·250). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €10 703 saved per additional patient who had treatment success with PCS compared with FLACS. We observed no severe adverse events during the femtosecond laser procedure, and most of the complications in the FLACS group related to the primary outcome measures occurred during the phacoemulsification phase or postoperatively.\nINTERPRETATION:\nDespite its advanced technology, femtosecond laser was not superior to phacoemulsification in cataract surgery and, with higher costs, did not provide an additional benefit over phacoemulsification for patients or health-care systems.\nFUNDING:\nFrench Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.\nCopyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Of these four hallmarks of cataract, it is protein-protein cross-linking that has been the most intransigent, and it is only recently, with the advent of proteomic methodology, that mechanisms are being elucidated. A diverse range of cross-linking processes involving several amino acids have been uncovered. Although other hypotheses for the etiology of cataract have been advanced, it is likely that spontaneous decomposition of the structural proteins of the lens, which do not turn over, is responsible for the age-related changes to the properties of the lens and, ultimately, for cataract.

The duration of the project is 3 years. During the first year of the project 17 patients were screened, SML implantation was recommended to 4 of them. They met the indication criteria of SML implantation and SML was implanted into the better seeing eye. The third postoperative day, the tES sessions started and were applied 20 times in the first month after SML implantation. The stimulation was delivered in double blind design (a stimulated and a shame group). Visual exercises and rehabilitation took place during the tES.

In comparative trials studying novel micro-invasive glaucoma surgeries in open angle glaucoma, the control group undergoing cataract extraction alone routinely achieved significant reductions in IOP and medication use postoperatively.

Pressure lowering is more significant in eyes with narrow angles and those with higher baseline IOP levels. In eyes with angle closure, phacoemulsification alone can lower IOP, but when combined with GSL it may be even more effective.

Disagreements about article inclusion were discussed and articles were included based on consensus. Data on study design, population, and findings were extracted from each article. Findings were synthesized qualitatively.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 1451 articles were screened for eligibility, 345 were selected for full-text review, and 26 were included. Study population mean ages ranged from 70.8 to 90.1 years. Three (12%) studies reported influenza estimates, 7 (27%) RSV, and 16 (62%) pneumonia. Eighteen (69%) studies reported incidence estimates, 7 (27%) prevalence estimates, and 1 (4%) both. Seven (27%) studies reported outbreaks. Respiratory infection incidence estimates ranged from 1.1 to 85.2% and prevalence estimates ranging from 1.4 to 55.8%. Influenza incidences ranged from 5.9 to 85.2%. RSV incidence proportions ranged from 1.1 to 13.5%. Pneumonia prevalence proportions ranged from 1.4 to 55.8% while incidence proportions ranged from 4.8 to 41.2%.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThe reported incidence and prevalence estimates of respiratory infections among older LTCF residents varied widely between published studies. The wide range of estimates offers little useful guidance for decision-making to decrease respiratory infection burden. Large, well-designed epidemiologic studies are therefore still necessary to credibly quantify the burden of respiratory infections among older adults in LTCFs, which will ultimately help inform future surveillance and intervention efforts.", "authors": ["Childs A", "Zullo AR", "Joyce NR", "McConeghy KW", "van Aalst R", "Moyo P", "Bosco E", "Mor V", "Gravenstein S"], "title": "The burden of respiratory infections among older adults in long-term care: a systematic review."}, {"references": null, "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6531851/", "publication": "BMJ. 2019 May 23;365:l1800. doi: 10.1136/bmj.l1800.", "topic": "Assisted Living", "abstract": "Abstract\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo determine whether extending initial prednisolone treatment from eight to 16 weeks in children with idiopathic steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome improves the pattern of disease relapse.\nDESIGN:\nDouble blind, parallel group, phase III randomised placebo controlled trial, including a cost effectiveness analysis.\nSETTING:\n125 UK National Health Service district general hospitals and tertiary paediatric nephrology centres.\nPARTICIPANTS:\n237 children aged 1-14 years with a first episode of steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome.\nINTERVENTIONS:\nChildren were randomised to receive an extended 16 week course of prednisolone (total dose 3150 mg/m2) or a standard eight week course of prednisolone (total dose 2240 mg/m2). The drug was supplied as 5 mg tablets alongside matching placebo so that participants in both groups received the same number of tablets at any time point in the study. A minimisation algorithm ensured balanced treatment allocation by ethnicity (South Asian, white, or other) and age (5 years or less, 6 years or more).\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:\nThe primary outcome measure was time to first relapse over a minimum follow-up of 24 months. Secondary outcome measures were relapse rate, incidence of frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome and steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome, use of alternative immunosuppressive treatment, rates of adverse events, behavioural change using the Achenbach child behaviour checklist, quality adjusted life years, and cost effectiveness from a healthcare perspective. Analysis was by intention to treat.\nRESULTS:\nNo significant difference was found in time to first relapse (hazard ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 1.17, log rank P=0.28) or in the incidence of frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome (extended course 60/114 (53%) v standard course 55/109 (50%), P=0.75), steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome (48/114 (42%) v 48/109 (44%), P=0.77), or requirement for alternative immunosuppressive treatment (62/114 (54%) v 61/109 (56%), P=0.81).

Softer landing surfaces, such as those provided by low-stiffness \"compliant\" flooring, may prevent fall-related injuries by decreasing the forces applied to the body during fall impact. Our primary objective was to assess the clinical effectiveness of compliant flooring at preventing serious fall-related injuries among LTC residents.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS:\nThe Flooring for Injury Prevention (FLIP) Study was a 4-year, randomized superiority trial in 150 single-occupancy resident rooms at a single Canadian LTC site. In April 2013, resident rooms were block randomized (1:1) to installation of intervention compliant flooring (2.54 cm SmartCells) or rigid control flooring (2.54 cm plywood) covered with identical hospital-grade vinyl. The primary outcome was serious fall-related injury over 4 years that required an emergency department visit or hospital admission and a treatment procedure or diagnostic evaluation in hospital. Secondary outcomes included minor fall-related injury, any fall-related injury, falls, and fracture. Outcomes were ascertained by blinded assessors between September 1, 2013 and August 31, 2017 and analyzed by intention to treat. Adverse outcomes were not assessed. During follow-up, 184 residents occupied 74 intervention rooms, and 173 residents occupied 76 control rooms. Residents were 64.3% female with mean (SD) baseline age 81.7 (9.5) years (range 51.1 to 104.6 years), body mass index 25.9 (7.7) kg/m2, and follow-up 1.64 (1.39) years. 1,907 falls were reported; 23 intervention residents experienced 38 serious injuries (from 29 falls in 22 rooms), while 23 control residents experienced 47 serious injuries (from 34 falls in 23 rooms). Compliant flooring did not affect odds of ≥1 serious fall-related injury (12.5% intervention versus 13.3% control, odds ratio [OR]: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.52 to 1.84, p = 0.950) or ≥2 serious fall-related injuries (5.4% versus 7.5%, OR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.31 to 1.75, p = 0.500). Compliant flooring did not affect rate of serious fall-related injuries (0.362 versus 0.422 per 1,000 bed nights, rate ratio [RR]: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.45 to 2.39, p = 0.925; 0.038 versus 0.053 per fall, RR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.38 to 1.71, p = 0.560), rate of falls with ≥1 serious fall-related injury (0.276 versus 0.303 per 1,000 bed nights, RR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.52 to 1.79, p = 0.920), or time to first serious fall-related injury (0.237 versus 0.257, hazard ratio [HR]: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.52 to 1.62, p = 0.760). Compliant flooring did not affect any secondary outcome in this study. Study limitations included the following: findings were specific to 2.54 cm SmartCells compliant flooring installed in LTC resident rooms, standard fall and injury prevention interventions were in use throughout the study and may have influenced the observed effect of compliant flooring, and challenges with concussion detection in LTC residents may have prevented estimation of the effect of compliant flooring on fall-related concussions.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nIn contrast to results from previous retrospective and nonrandomized studies, this study found that compliant flooring underneath hospital-grade vinyl was not effective at preventing serious fall-related injuries in LTC.

Although obstructive sleep apnea is increasingly recognized as a common comorbidity of mild cognitive impairment, most apnea research has focused on middle-aged adults with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea. Mild obstructive sleep apnea, defined as 5-14 apneas or hypopneas per hour slept, is common in older adults. Little is known about the effect on cognition of adherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in older adults with mild obstructive sleep apnea and mild cognitive impairment.\nOBJECTIVE:\nThe objective of this study was to explore the effect of CPAP adherence on cognition in older adults with mild obstructive sleep apnea and mild cognitive impairment.\nMETHODS:\nWe conducted a secondary analysis of data from Memories 1, a 1-year quasiexperimental clinical trial on the effect of CPAP adherence in older adults with mild cognitive impairment and obstructive sleep apnea. Those with mild obstructive sleep apnea were divided into two groups based on their CPAP adherence over 1 year: (a) CPAP adherent group (mild cognitive impairment + CPAP) with an average CPAP use of ≥4 hours per night and (b) CPAP nonadherent group (mild cognitive impairment - CPAP) with an average CPAP use of <4 hours per night. Individuals currently using CPAP were not eligible. A CPAP adherence intervention was provided for all participants, and an attention control intervention was provided for participants who chose to discontinue CPAP use during the 1-year follow-up. Descriptive baseline analyses, paired t tests for within-group changes, and general linear and logistic regression models for between-group changes were conducted.\nRESULTS:\nThose in the mild cognitive impairment + CPAP group compared to the mild cognitive impairment - CPAP group demonstrated a significant improvement in psychomotor/cognitive processing speed, measured by the Digit Symbol Coding Test. Eight participants improved on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, whereas six worsened or were unchanged. Twelve participants rated themselves as improved on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change Scale, whereas three reported their status as worsened or unchanged. The mild cognitive impairment + CPAP group had greater than an eightfold increased odds of improving on the Clinical Dementia Rating and greater than a ninefold increased odds of improving on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change Scale, compared to the mild cognitive impairment - CPAP group.\nDISCUSSION:\nCPAP adherence may be a promising intervention for slowing cognitive decline in older adults with mild obstructive sleep apnea and mild cognitive impairment.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and neurocognitive tests were performed before and after the 3-month intervention. A temporal efficiency analysis approach was used to examine the spatiotemporal networks of the brain.\nRESULTS:\nParticipants in the mindfulness group had significantly better temporal global efficiency than controls after 3-months of intervention. Localized changes of temporal nodal properties were present in the right cingulate gyrus, insula, and left superior temporal gyrus. Together, these results suggest greater information transmission efficiency at both the global and local spatiotemporal level. In terms of cognitive function, verbal recognition memory improved in the mindfulness group compared to the controls.\nCONCLUSION:\nElders who practiced mindfulness had better brain network efficiency and neurocognitive function relative to controls in this study, suggesting that mindfulness may be of benefit to aging adults with early cognitive degeneration.\n© 2019 The Authors.

Neurofeedback (NF), which is a training mechanism that employs operant conditioning to regulate brain activity, has been increasingly investigated concerning its beneficial effects for dementia and MCI.\nMETHODS:\nThis study investigated cognitive improvement and hemodynamic changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) following NF training in patients with MCI. Five patients with MCI received NF training for enhanced beta band activity in the dorsolateral PFC-16 sessions for 8 weeks-with each session divided into 9 5-minute trials. The primary outcome measure was a cognitive assessment tool: the Korean version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The secondary outcome measures were the Central Nervous System Vital Signs for neurocognitive testing, hemodynamic changes using functional near-infrared spectroscopy in the PFC during a working-memory task, and Beck Depression Inventory scores.\nRESULTS:\nAfter completing the training, patients' cognitive function significantly improved in domains such as composite memory, cognitive flexibility, complex attention, reaction time, and executive function. Increased electroencephalogram beta power was observed over NF training sessions (Spearman rank correlation test: r = 0.746, P = .001). The threshold value for gaining positive feedback from pre-NF baseline on beta power significantly increased (Spearman rank correlation test: r = 0.805, P = .001). Hemodynamic response in PFC changed after NF training, and individual differences were identified. Specifically, hypoactivation of the hemodynamic response by emotional distraction recovered following NF training.\nCONCLUSION:\nWe suggest that patients' cognitive processing efficiency was improved by the NF training.

Previous clinical trials testing whether cholinesterase inhibitors can slow the rate of progression from MCI to AD dementia have yielded disappointing results. However, recent studies of the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in AD have demonstrated improvements in cognitive function. Because few rTMS trials have been conducted in MCI, we designed a trial to test the short-term efficacy of rTMS in MCI. Yet, in both MCI and AD, we know little about what site of stimulation would be ideal for improving cognitive function. Therefore, two cortical sites will be investigated in this trial: (1) the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which has been well studied for treatment of major depressive disorder; and (2) the lateral parietal cortex (LPC), a novel site with connectivity to AD-relevant limbic regions.\nMETHODS/DESIGN:\nIn this single-site trial, we plan to enroll 99 participants with single or multi-domain amnestic MCI. We will randomize participants to one of three groups: (1) Active DLPFC rTMS; (2) Active LPC rTMS; and (3) Sham rTMS (evenly split between DLPFC and LPC locations). After completing 20 bilateral rTMS treatment sessions, participants will be followed for 6 months to test short-term efficacy and track durability of effects. The primary efficacy measure is the California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II), assessed 1 week after intervention. Secondary analyses will examine effects of rTMS on other cognitive measures, symptoms of depression, and brain function with respect to the site of stimulation. Finally, selected biomarkers will be analyzed to explore predictors of response and mechanisms of action.\nDISCUSSION:\nThe primary aim of this trial is to test the short-term efficacy of rTMS in MCI. Additionally, the project will provide information on the durability of cognitive effects and potentially distinct effects of stimulating DLPFC versus LPC regions. Future efforts would be directed toward better understanding therapeutic mechanisms and optimizing rTMS for treatment of MCI. Ultimately, if rTMS can be utilized to slow the rate of progression to AD dementia, this will be a significant advancement in the field.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION:\nClinical Trials NCT03331796.

Health literacy was measured using the Chinese Citizen Health Literacy Questionnaire.\nRESULTS:\nThe scores of total health literacy and its three dimensions (basic health knowledge and mind, basic skills, and health lifestyle and behavior) were lower in those with mild cognitive impairment. Older adults with normal cognitive function had adequate or marginal health literacy levels, whereas those with mild cognitive impairment had marginal or inadequate health literacy levels. Using multiple logistic regression analysis, we found that health literacy risk, education level, age, marital status, and body mass index were independent risk factors for mild cognitive impairment.\nDISCUSSION:\nThese results suggest that low health literacy may be a predictor of mild cognitive impairment.

We assessed its safety and potential efficacy in a 3-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and medial temporal lobe atrophy.\nMETHODS:\nPatients 55 to 85 years of age with MCI, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 0.5, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score >24, Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Verbal Paired Associates I score ≤18, and Medial Temporal Lobe Atrophy Scale score >1 were stratified by APOE ε4 genotype and randomly assigned (1:1) to ladostigil 10 mg/d or placebo. Primary outcomes were safety and onset of Alzheimer disease dementia. Secondary endpoints were Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) composite, Disability Assessment in Dementia (DAD), and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) scores. Exploratory outcomes were NTB component, CDR, and MMSE scores. Biomarkers included MRI-derived whole-brain, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex volumes.\nRESULTS:\nTwo hundred ten patients from 15 sites in Austria, Germany, and Israel were randomly allocated to placebo (107 patients) or ladostigil (103 patients). After 36 months, 21 of 103 patients on placebo and 14 of 99 patients receiving ladostigil progressed to Alzheimer disease (log-rank test p = 0.162).

Injection therapy with urethral bulking agents or stem cell formulations have been developed as minimally invasive alternatives. Many synthetic and biological bulking agents have been trialled, but several have been discontinued owing to safety concerns. The use of Macroplastique and Contigen has the largest evidence base, but, overall, success rates seem to be similar between the various agents and positive outcomes are poorly sustained for more than 6 months. Furthermore, subjective cure rates, although initially high, also deteriorate over time. The available data consistently demonstrate manifestly poorer outcomes for injection therapies than for surgery. Stem cell treatments are thought to functionally regenerate the urethral sphincter in patients with suspected intrinsic sphincter deficiency. Autologous adipose and muscle-derived stem cells seem to be the intuitive cell source, as they are comparatively abundant, can be harvested and cause minimal donor site morbidity. To date, only a few small clinical studies have been reported and most data are derived from animal models. The success rates of stem cell injection therapies seem to be comparable with those of bulking agents.", "authors": ["Hillary CJ", "Roman S", "MacNeil S", "Aicher WK", "Stenzl A", "Chapple CR"], "title": "Regenerative medicine and injection therapies in stress urinary incontinence."}, {"references": null, "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7003810/", "publication": "Int J Gynaecol Obstet. 2020 Jan;148 Suppl 1:22-26. doi: 10.1002/ijgo.13035.", "topic": "Urinary Incontinence", "abstract": "Abstract\nAlthough approximately 2 million women suffer from an obstetric fistula, the surgical literature is sparse.

To evaluate the effectiveness of point-of-care informational interventions in general practitioner clinics to improve influenza and pneumococcal vaccination uptake among elderly patients.Methods. We conducted a pragmatic, cluster-randomized crossover trial in 22 private general practitioner clinics in Singapore, from November 2017 to July 2018. We included all patients aged 65 years or older. Clinics were assigned to a 3-month intervention (flyers and posters encouraging vaccination) plus 1-month washout period, and a 4-month control period (usual care). Primary outcomes were differences in vaccination uptake rates between periods. Secondary outcomes were identification of other factors associated with vaccination uptake.Results. A total of 4378 and 4459 patients were included in the intervention and control periods, respectively. Both influenza (5.9% vs 4.8%; P = .047) and pneumococcal (5.7% vs 3.7%; P = .001) vaccination uptake rates were higher during the intervention period compared with the control period.

PA is an important marker of health and quality of life in older adults. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature to assess the effect of exercise-based interventions on an at least six-month follow up PA measure, and to describe the specific strategies implemented during the intervention to strengthen the sustainability of PA in community-dwelling 65+ year-old adults. We registered and conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD42017070892) of randomized clinical trials (RCT). We searched three electronic databases during January 2018 to identify RCT assessing any type of exercise-based intervention. Studies had to report a pre-, post-, and at least 6-month post-intervention follow-up. To be included, at least one PA outcome had to be assessed. The effect of exercise-based interventions was assessed compared to active (e.g., a low-intensity type of exercise, such as stretching or toning activities) and non-active (e.g., usual care) control interventions at several time points. Secondary analyses were conducted, restricted to studies that reported specific strategies to enhance the sustainability of PA. The intervention effect was measured on self-reported and objective measures of time spent in PA, by means of standardized mean differences. Standardized mean differences of PA level were pooled. Pooled estimates of effect were computed with the DerSimonian-Laird method, applying a random effects model. The risk of bias was also assessed. We included 12 studies, comparing 18 exercise intervention groups to four active and nine non-active control groups. Nine studies reported specific strategies to enhance the long-term sustainability of PA. The strategies were mostly related to the self-efficacy, self-control, and behavior capability principles based on the social cognitive theory. Exercise interventions compared to active control showed inconclusive and heterogeneous results. When compared to non-active control, exercise interventions improved PA time at the six-months follow up (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.30; 95%CI 0.15 to 0.44; four studies; 724 participants; I2 0%), but not at the one- or two-years follow-ups. No data were available on the mid- and long-term effect of adding strategies to enhance the sustainability of PA.

Secondly, many rural older people face social isolation which impacts their health. In addressing the first issue, we discovered that our project, Older Persons Teaching and Empowering Aged Care Students (OPTEACH), has the potential to have a positive impact on the second issue.\nDESIGN:\nWe run university education sessions involving older people. Since such sessions present unique challenges, we obtained a grant to develop resources to assist educators and support rural older people to become \"OPTEACHers.\"\nSETTING:\nOPTEACH was undertaken in several rural communities in New South Wales and included staff and residents at residential aged care facilities and community-dwelling rural older people.\nKEY MEASURES FOR IMPROVEMENT:\nOur previous work had highlighted a need for educator resources that would facilitate \"ageing\" being taught in a way that both involved and respected older people. Our ethos centres on the \"co-creation\" of knowledge, and having older peoples' unique contributions recognised and celebrated.\nSTRATEGIES FOR CHANGE:\nResources to assist with planning and being involved in OPTEACH education sessions are available at www.opteach.com.au. They will support a growing community of \"OPTEACHers,\" with beneficial flow-on effects for rural older people.\nEFFECTS OF CHANGE:\nWe seek to provide practical support to both educators and older people to provide \"real life\" education on the experience of ageing.\nNEXT STEPS:\nFurther evaluation is needed, yet we anticipate a positive impact on self-esteem, community \"connectedness\" and quality of life for older rural \"OPTEACHers\" as the approach gains momentum.\n© 2019 National Rural Health Alliance Ltd.", "authors": ["Hughes C", "Bernoth M", "Winkler D"], "title": "Increasing the social participation of older rural residents: Opportunities offered by \"OPTEACH\"."}, {"references": null, "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1891/1078-4535.25.2.126", "publication": "Creat Nurs. 2019 May 1;25(2):126-132. doi: 10.1891/1078-4535.25.2.126.", "topic": "Healthy Aging", "abstract": "Abstract\nLack of adherence to medication plans is a factor in costly hospital readmissions.

The primary endpoints were the composite outcome of recurrent ischemic neurological events [stroke and/or transient ischemic attack (TIA)].

We sought to determine whether prior GIB in patients with AF taking anticoagulants was associated with an increased risk of stroke or major hemorrhage.\nMETHODS:\nWe analyzed key efficacy and safety outcomes in patients with prior GIB in ARISTOTLE. Centrally adjudicated outcomes according to GIB history were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for randomized treatment and established risk factors.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 784 (4.3%) patients had prior GIB events (321 [41%] lower, 463 [59%] upper); 215 (27%) occurred <1 year before study enrollment. Patients with prior GIB were older, had more comorbidities, and higher CHADS2 and HAS-BLED scores than those with no GIB. Major GIB occurred more frequently in those with prior GIB (lower: aHR 1.72, 95% CI 0.86-3.42; upper: aHR 3.13, 95% CI 1.97-4.96). This association with major GIB was more pronounced in patients with GIB <1 year before randomization versus no recent GIB (recent lower: aHR 2.58, 95% CI 0.95-7.01; recent upper: aHR 5.16, 95% CI 2.66-10.0).

Unfortunately, despite the use of evidence-based therapies, patients with ASCVD continue to have recurrent major adverse cardiovascular events including death, myocardial infarction, and stroke-at a rate of approximately 2%-4% per year. To combat this continuing risk, several recent trials have evaluated the efficacy and safety of more intensive antithrombotic strategies through prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), combining a P2Y12 receptor antagonists and low-dose aspirin, or alternatively applying a dual pathway inhibition approach, combining low-dose non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulant and low-dose aspirin. Both combination strategies have been shown to reduce recurrent ischemic events but at the cost of increased bleeding events. The clinical application of these antithrombotic strategies requires clinicians to assess and balance the risk of recurrent ischemic and bleeding events in an individual patient. Furthermore, clinicians may also need to adapt their antithrombotic strategies to achieve best patient outcomes, as ASCVD is a progressive disease and the risks of cardiovascular ischemic and bleeding events may shift over time. This state-of-the-art article reviews evidence from the trials and provides a practical approach to the application of DAPT and dual pathway antithrombotic therapy in the long-term management of patients with chronic ASCVD.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The expert opinion based Delphi anatomical risk (DAR) score was developed to predict difficulty of CAS in relation to procedural stroke risk, and thereby aid patient selection. The aim was to validate the DAR score in the context of a randomised clinical trial.\nMETHODS:\nIn this post hoc analysis of the International Carotid Stenting Study (ICSS), only patients treated by CAS with available pre-procedural CT angiography (CTA) were included. Patients with tortuous anatomy unsuitable for stenting were excluded from ICSS. CTA based vascular anatomy was rated by two independent observers. Every possible combination of anatomy resulted in a risk score, divided in four categories of expected risk (low, < 5.0; low-intermediate, 5.0-5.9; high-intermediate, 6.0-6.9; high, ≥ 7.0). Binomial logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between anatomical risk score and procedural risk of any stroke. Differences between predefined age groups were also assessed.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 275 patients were included. Interobserver reliability for all anatomical risk factors was high (κ = 0.76-0.84). In total, 16 strokes (6%) occurred in the procedural period. No significant relationship was observed between the DAR score and risk of procedural stroke, with the risk of stroke being 9% in the high risk vs. 4% in the low risk categories (p = .49). A higher mean DAR score was observed in patients ≥70 years compared with younger patients (4.6 ± 1.5 vs. 3.9 ± 1.4, p < .001), which was mainly explained by higher rates of arch atheroma (44% vs. 20%, p < .001). Prolonged intervention duration was significantly associated with increased stroke risk (11% vs. 4%, p < .04), but not with the DAR score.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nNo statistically significant association was found between anatomical difficulty, as defined in the DAR score, and procedural stroke risk. However, the small sample size potentially rendered the study underpowered to detect group differences, and confirmation with a larger sample is essential.\nCopyright © 2019 European Society for Vascular Surgery.

Atrial high rate episodes lasting longer than five minutes are likely to represent SCAF. SCAF has been associated with an increased risk of stroke that is particularly significant when episodes of SCAF are greater than 23 h in duration. Longer episodes of SCAF are incrementally more likely to progress to episodes of SCAF >23 h as time progresses.

Recurrent stroke has significantly higher morbidity and mortality. Among modifiable risk factors for recurrent stroke, hypertension is the most prevalent. Reducing systolic blood pressure is standard of care for secondary stroke prevention. Recent literature suggests that increased blood pressure variability (BPV) is associated with primary stroke, although studies have not convincingly shown that it is associated with recurrent stroke, which was the goal of this analysis. Methods- We conducted a secondary analysis of 17 916 patients in the PRoFESS (Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes) trial, which is the largest trial of patients with potential recurrent stroke. We calculated BPV and evaluated its effect on recurrent stroke (composite and stratified by ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke), major cardiovascular events (death from cardiovascular causes, recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, or new or worsening heart failure), and all-cause death. Results- Both systolic and diastolic BPV were associated with recurrent stroke, major cardiovascular events, and all-cause death. The association with stroke was significant for ischemic, but not hemorrhagic, stroke. For every 10-point increase in BPV (systolic SD, range =0-54.2), the hazard ratio for a recurrent ischemic stroke was 1.15 (95% CI, 1.02-1.32; P=0.02), for major cardiovascular events was 1.19 (95% CI, 1.09-1.31; P<0.001), and for all-cause death was 1.24 (95% CI, 1.10-1.39; P<0.001). Conclusions- Our study adds to the growing body of literature suggesting that BPV is an important and potentially modifiable risk factor for ischemic stroke, cardiovascular events, and all-cause death. Specifically, it is the first study to demonstrate that increased BPV is associated with recurrent ischemic stroke and that diastolic BPV can be as important as systolic BPV. Future work should focus on evaluating whether actively reducing BPV, using widely available and inexpensive antihypertensive medications, reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease.", "authors": ["de Havenon A", "Fino NF", "Johnson B", "Wong KH", "Majersik JJ", "Tirschwell D", "Rost N"], "title": "Blood Pressure Variability and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients With Prior Stroke: A Secondary Analysis of PRoFESS."}, {"references": null, "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022215120000535", "publication": "J Laryngol Otol. 2020 Mar;134(3):241-246. doi: 10.1017/S0022215120000535.

The modified approach involves a fenestrated approach to the maxillary sinus. The bony pedicled windows of maxillary sinus in some selected cases may limit some of the most common complications and it may reduce healing times.\nEVIDENCE ACQUISITION:\nEvaluation of the middle term results of a maxillary fenestrated sinus approach as an alternative technique to CL and review of literature.\nEVIDENCE SYNTHESIS:\nFrom 2013 to 2017 thirty-one patients were treated with the CL modified technique, most of which for foreign bodies, displacement of endodontic material and implants in the maxillary sinus, large mucoceles and odontogenic maxillary sinusitis.

There has been no recurrence of the starting problem and all treated patients were free from residual maxillary pathology 18 months after surgery. Four works meeting the inclusion criteria were identified.

Among the cytokines that cause EMT, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) has been shown to give rise to EMT in airway epithelial cells. However, the mechanism of HMGB1-induced EMT in ECRSwNP is unknown. We explored the mechanism and possible inhibitor. Immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF), and western blot assay were used to detect the expression and location of HMGB1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), and EMT markers in eighteen ECRSwNP and twelve normal nasal mucosa tissues. Epithelial cells isolated from ECRSwNP were cultured with various doses of recombinant human HMGB1 (rhHMGB1) to study the expression of PPAR-γ, and EMT markers. Additionally, the ligand of PPAR-γ was incubated with epithelial cells to interfere with the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or rhHMGB1 to explore the effect on expression of HMGB1 and EMT markers. These results suggest that HMGB1 was highly expressed in ECRSwNP compared with its expression in control tissues, and EMT was also found highly in ECRSwNP compared with control tissues. Moreover, the cytoplasmic accumulation of HMGB1 in ECRSwNP was obvious compared with normal tissues. We also found dose-dependent induction by rhHMGB1 of up-regulation of N-cadherin and vimentin and down-regulation of ZO-1 and E-cadherin in epithelial cells isolated from ECRSwNP. The agonist of PPAR-γ not only reduced release of HMGB1 induced by LPS, but also reversed the EMT. The protective role of PPAR-γ also appeared in cells that had been incubated with rhHMGB1. In the current study, we discovered that the agonist of PPAR-γ has a potential role in inhibited HMGB1-induced EMT in ECRSwNP.

Because the pathophysiology of chronic cough is complicated, the management of chronic cough is challenging. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has examined the effect of macrolide antibiotics in chronic cough patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. The purpose of this study is to determine the changes in lung function for chronic cough patients with chronic rhinosinusitis who are treated by clarithromycin and carbocisteine.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\nThirty-two chronic cough patients with chronic rhinosinusitis were recruited. Patients using inhaled corticosteroids and/or a bronchodilator, asthmatic patients, and patients with abnormal findings on auscultation and/or chest X-ray examination were excluded from this study. The patients received low-dose clarithromycin treatment for 3 months. Both before and after the treatment, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the paranasal sinuses, lung function test, peripheral blood test, and sino-nasal outcome test (SNOT-20) were applied.\nRESULTS:\nBoth the lung function and Lund-MacKay CT scores were improved by the long-duration therapy with macrolide antibiotics. The change in obstructive pulmonary function and the improvement of the CT score in each subject were significantly correlated. SNOT scores also improved after the treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThe macrolide antibiotics treatment has beneficial effects on lung function in non-asthmatic chronic cough patients with normal chest X-ray findings. The improvement of chronic rhinosinusitis may have some role in the lung condition.

Understanding of the different treatments of CRS is very significant in selecting appropriate therapies and preventing exacerbation relevant to this chronic inflammation. This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of Chinese traditional medicine lianhuaqingwen granules on CRSsNP.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\nCRSsNP patients were enrolled and randomized into placebo or lianhuaqingwen (LHQW) granules treatment group (placebo or LHQW group). Their clinical symptoms were scored using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT)-22. Nitric oxide (NO) from nasal cavity and sinus and nasal resistance were also examined. Then, nasal biopsy samples and nasal lavage fluid (NLF) were obtained from these patients, and histologic characteristics of nasal mucosa and T cell subpopulations patterns in the NLF were evaluated. Finally, inflammatory mediators in the NLF were assessed in both groups.\nRESULTS:\nOne hundred and forty patients with CRSsNP finished this one-month study. VAS and SNOT-22 scores and nasal resistance were all decreased distinctly after the treatment of LHQW, but not after placebo. However, the nasal NO concentration was increased in LHQW administration group in comparison with placebo group. There were significant differences in above parameters between these two treatments. Histologic changes in nasal mucosa were improved only in LHQW group. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were all downregulated in the LHQW treatment group, but not in placebo group. Inflammatory mediators from the NLF were decreased in LHQW treatment group compared to placebo group. Furthermore, there were significant changes between these two groups in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subpopulations and concentrations of inflammatory substances.\nCONCLUSION:\nThese findings demonstrate that LHQW granules treatment may control the inflammation in nasal mucosa and result in the improvement of CRSsNP.

Polyps recurrence rate ranges from 4% to 60%, so it's clear that not all clinical and immunologic factors associated with recurrence are known.\nOBJECTIVE:\nWe investigate the inflammatory profile in patients with long term recurrent and non-recurrent CRSwNPs and if a specific profile is associated with recurrence, comparing eosinophilic, neutrophilic and lymphocytic infiltration, as well as IL-5 and IL-8 expression to long term recurrence rate.\nMETHODS:\nThis prospective study included 44 adult patients with CRSwNP treated with endoscopic sinus surgery between 2008 and 2010. Long term follow-up data (8-10 years) indicated that among 44 patients, 18 (40.1%) experienced long term recurrence of nasal polyposis needing maximal medical treatment or revision surgery. We realized two groups: one with patients who didn't present long term recurrence (26 patients) and another with patients who presented long term recurrence (18 patients) and in both groups eosinophilic, neutrophilic and lymphocytic infiltration and IL-5 and IL-8 expression were measured.\nRESULTS:\nThe parameters that reached statistical significance (p < 0.05) comparing the two groups were eosinophilic infiltration and IL-5 expression, whereas neutrophilic and lymphocytic infiltration, as IL-8 expression didn't show any significant difference. Asthma and aspirin intolerance seemed significantly more frequent in patients with recurrence, while allergy presented not statistically significant difference between two groups.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nWe can conclude that high eosinophilic infiltration and high IL-5 expression in CRSwNP correlate with higher rate of long term recurrence, while neutrophilic and lymphocytic infiltration, and IL-8 expression don't correlate with it. These findings provide the opportunity to improve our ability to predict the prognosis of surgical intervention, although it is still needed to explore the optimal predictor of outcome in CRSwNP.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a validated instrument for diagnosing depression, has been used to assess depression in a variety of clinical settings. PHQ-9 scores ≥10 are the threshold for a depression diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of depression in a rhinology practice and compare the PHQ-9 with the 22-item Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22).\nSTUDY DESIGN:\nRetrospective chart review.\nSETTING:\nTertiary rhinology practice.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS:\nDuring the 2-month period ending April 30, 2018, all rhinology patients were asked to complete the PHQ-9 and SNOT-22.\nRESULTS:\nAmong 216 patients, 46 (21.3%) had a self-reported history of depression, and 39 (18.1%) had a PHQ-9 score ≥10. Of the 39 patients screening positive for depression, 18 (41.9%) had no history of depression. Comparison of PHQ-9 with overall SNOT-22 score had a Pearson's coefficient of 0.632 (P < .005). Logistic regression showed that the highest 2 quintiles of SNOT-22 scores had an odds ratio of 60.6 (95% CI, 9.7-378.3) for a positive depression screen (PHQ-9 score ≥10).\nCONCLUSION:\nDepression rates (estimated by PHQ-9 responses) among rhinology patients are similar to chronic disease populations; depression may be underdiagnosed in rhinology patients. Higher SNOT-22 scores were associated with higher PHQ-9 scores.

One randomized clinical trial (RCT) (n = 4005) examined the direct effect of screening for cognitive impairment on patient outcomes, including potential harms, finding no significant differences in health-related quality of life at 12 months (effect size, 0.009 [95% CI, -0.063 to 0.080]). Fifty-nine studies (n = 38 531) addressed the accuracy of 49 screening instruments to detect cognitive impairment. The Mini-Mental State Examination was the most-studied instrument, with a pooled sensitivity of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85 to 0.92) and specificity of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85 to 0.93) to detect dementia using a cutoff of 23 or less or 24 or less (15 studies, n = 12 796).

Most cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, atrial fibrillation and smoking are not exclusive risk factors for vascular dementia but also for Alzheimer's disease. The ApoE4 allele is the single non-modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Today we know that an important, modifiable risk factor is education. Better education means better protection against dementia. A large number of dementia cases are potentially preventable by early intervention. Early changes in the blood vessel wall can be detected by early ultrasound methods or early biomarkers. These methods allow us to detect changes before the disease becomes clinically evident. Early disease detection enables timely management, and studies have shown that careful control of vascular risk factors can postpone the onset or even reverse disease progression.\n©Carol Davila University Press.", "authors": ["Morovic S", "Budincevic H", "Govori V", "Demarin V"], "title": "Possibilities of Dementia Prevention - It is Never Too Early to Start."}, {"references": null, "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1037/pag0000401", "publication": "Psychol Aging. 2020 Feb;35(1):55-77. doi: 10.1037/pag0000401.", "topic": "Dementia", "abstract": "Abstract\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis compared the effects of 131 randomized controlled trials, published between 2006 and mid-2018, for dementia caregivers with community-dwelling care-recipients.

Thus, there is a pressing need for accurate tools to detect cognitive impairment in routine clinical practice. The Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III), and the mini-ACE are brief, bedside cognitive screens that have previously reported good sensitivity and specificity. The quality and quantity of this evidence has not, however, been robustly investigated.\nOBJECTIVES:\nTo assess the diagnostic test accuracy of the ACE-III and mini-ACE for the detection of dementia, dementia sub-types, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at published thresholds in primary, secondary, and community care settings in patients presenting with, or at high risk of, cognitive decline.\nSEARCH METHODS:\nWe performed the search for this review on 13 February 2019. We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), BIOSIS Previews (ISI Web of Knowledge), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Knowledge), PsycINFO (OvidSP), and LILACS (BIREME). We applied no language or date restrictions to the electronic searches; and to maximise sensitivity we did not use methodological filters. The search yielded 5655 records, of which 2937 remained after we removed duplicates. We identified a further four articles through PubMed 'related articles'. We found no additional records through reference list citation searching, or grey literature.\nSELECTION CRITERIA:\nCross-sectional studies investigating the accuracy of the ACE-III or mini-ACE in patients presenting with, or at high risk of, cognitive decline were suitable for inclusion. We excluded case-control, delayed verification and longitudinal studies, and studies which investigated a secondary cause of dementia. We did not restrict studies by language; and we included those with pre-specified thresholds (88 and 82 for the ACE-III, and 21 or 25 for the mini-ACE).\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:\nWe extracted information on study and participant characteristics and used information on dementia and MCI prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, and sample size to generate 2×2 tables in Review Manager 5. We assessed methodological quality of included studies using the QUADAS-2 tool; and we assessed the quality of study reporting with the STARDdem tool. Due to significant heterogeneity in the included studies and an insufficient number of studies, we did not perform meta-analyses.\nMAIN RESULTS:\nThis review identified seven studies (1711 participants in total) of cross-sectional design, four examining the accuracy of the ACE-III, and three of the mini-ACE. Overall, the majority of studies were at low or unclear risk of bias and applicability on quality assessment. Studies were at high risk of bias for the index test (n = 4) and reference standard (n = 2). Study reporting was variable across the included studies. No studies investigated dementia sub-types. The ACE-III had variable sensitivity across thresholds and patient populations (range for dementia at 82 and 88: 82% to 97%, n = 2; range for MCI at 88: 75% to 77%, n = 2), but with more variability in specificity (range for dementia: 4% to 77%, n = 2; range for MCI: 89% to 92%, n = 2). Similarly, sensitivity of the mini-ACE was variable (range for dementia at 21 and 25: 70% to 99%, n = 3; range for MCI at 21 and 25: 64% to 95%, n = 3) but with more variability specificity (range for dementia: 32% to 100%, n = 3; range for MCI: 46% to 79%, n = 3). We identified no studies in primary care populations: four studies were conducted in outpatient clinics, one study in an in-patient setting, and in two studies the settings were unclear.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:\nThere is insufficient information in terms of both quality and quantity to recommend the use of either the ACE-III or mini-ACE for the screening of dementia or MCI in patients presenting with, or at high risk of, cognitive decline. No studies were conducted in a primary care setting so the accuracy of the ACE-III and mini-ACE in this setting are not known. Lower thresholds (82 for the ACE-III, and 21 for the mini-ACE) provide better specificity with acceptable sensitivity and may provide better clinical utility. The ACE-III and mini-ACE should only be used to support the diagnosis as an adjunct to a full clinical assessment. Further research is needed to determine the utility of the ACE-III and mini-ACE for the detection of dementia, dementia sub-types, and MCI. Specifically, the optimal thresholds for detection need to be determined in a variety of settings (primary care, secondary care (inpatient and outpatient), and community services), prevalences, and languages.\nCopyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Metabolic disorders including diabetes mellitus and obesity are independent predictors of atrial fibrillation and present therapeutic targets to reduce both the incidence and duration burden of atrial fibrillation. The presence of pericardial fat in direct contact with cardiac structures, as well the subsequent release of proinflammatory cytokines, may play an important role in this connection. Atrial fibrillation is an independent predictor of cognitive impairment and dementia. While clinical stroke is a major contributor, other factors such as cerebral hypoperfusion and microbleeds play important roles. New evidence suggests that atrial fibrillation and cognitive impairment may be downstream events of atrial cardiomyopathy, which may be caused by several factors including metabolic syndrome, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea. The mechanisms linking these comorbidities to cognitive impairment are not yet fully elucidated. A clearer understanding of the association of AF with dementia and cognitive impairment is imperative.

This report describes the practical benefits and challenges of using integrated FDG-PET-MRI to support the clinical diagnosis of various dementias. Over the past 7 years, we have performed integrated FDG-PET-MRI on >1500 patients with possible cognitive impairment or dementia.

An additional Dixon MRI sequence with superimposed bone atlas is used to calculate PET attenuation correction. A single radiologist interprets all imaging data and generates 1 report. The most common positive finding is concordant temporoparietal volume loss and FDG hypometabolism that suggests increased risk for underlying Alzheimer disease. Lobar-specific atrophy and FDG hypometabolism patterns that may be subtle, asymmetric, and focal also are more easily recognized using combined FDG-PET and MRI, thereby improving detection of other neurodegeneration conditions such as primary progressive aphasias and frontotemporal degeneration. Integrated PET-MRI has many practical benefits to individual patients, referrers, and interpreting radiologists.

As a result, it has been a major cause of functional deterioration among varying populations in the world. This study is aimed at reviewing the epidemiology of dementia in Arab countries in terms of its prevalence, distribution, and risk factors.\nMETHODS:\nA systematic literature review was conducted using articles published in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and other local journals between 1990 and 2018. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 18 studies were concluded to be eligible for the review.\nRESULTS:\nPrevalence studies demonstrated that dementia is indeed a prevalent condition in Arab countries, ranging between 1.1% and 2.3% among age groups of 50 years and older, as well as between 13.5% and 18.5% among age groups of 80 years and above. However, these results are not different from those of many other countries in the world. Moreover, prevalence was found to vary depending on sociodemographic characteristics. Major risk factors of dementia included hypertension, low income, and low education, while the risk of developing dementia is increased by obesity, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular risk factors. Despite the growing evidence regarding the epidemiological distribution and determinants of dementia worldwide, studies from the Arab region remain scarce.\nCONCLUSION:\nThis systematic review highlights the need for population-based studies to provide necessary information for developing preventive and curative strategies specific to the Arab region.\nCopyright © 2019 Ashraf El-Metwally et al.", "authors": ["El-Metwally A", "Toivola P", "Al-Rashidi M", "Nooruddin S", "Jawed M", "AlKanhal R", "Razzak HA", "Albawardi N"], "title": "Epidemiology of Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia in Arab Countries: A Systematic Review."}, {"references": null, "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ahj.2020.01.009", "publication": "Am Heart J. 2020 Apr;222:183-190. doi: 10.1016/j.ahj.2020.01.009.

Praliciguat (IW-1973), a novel soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator that may help restore deficient nitric oxide-soluble guanylate cyclase-cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate signaling, is being investigated for the treatment of patients with HFpEF.\nMETHODS:\nCAPACITY HFpEF is a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of praliciguat over 12 weeks in approximately 184 patients with HFpEF. Eligible patients must have evidence supporting clinical HFpEF and at least 2 of the following 4 conditions associated with NO deficiency: diabetes/prediabetes, hypertension, obesity, and age >70 years. The primary efficacy end point is the change from baseline in peak VO2 by cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). Secondary end points include the change from baseline in 6-minute walk test distance and the change in ventilatory efficiency on CPET, as well as number of CPET responders.

Although growing evidence suggests beneficial effects on myocardial remodeling, fluid balance and cardiac function, the impact of empagliflozin initiated early after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has not been investigated yet. Therefore, the impact of EMpagliflozin on cardiac function and biomarkers of heart failure in patients with acute MYocardial infarction (EMMY) trial was designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin in diabetic and non-diabetic patients after severe AMI.\nMETHODS:\nWithin a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3b trial we will enroll patients with AMI and characteristics suggestive of severe myocardial necrosis are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or matching placebo. The primary endpoint is the impact of empagliflozin on changes in NT-proBNP within 6 months after AMI. Secondary endpoints include changes in echocardiographic parameters, levels of ketone body concentrations, HbA1c levels and body weight, respectively. Hospitalization rate due to heart failure or other causes, the duration of hospital stay and all-cause mortality will be assessed as exploratory secondary endpoints.\nDISCUSSION:\nThe EMMY trial will test empagliflozin in patients with AMI regardless of their diabetic status. The EMMY trial may therefore underpin the concept of SGLT2 inhibition to improve cardiac remodeling, pre-and afterload reduction and cardiac metabolism regardless of its antidiabetic effects.

We examine the logistical and statistical implications of variations in SW design using the optimization of the Patient-Centered Care Transitions in Heart Failure trial for illustration. We review the following complete SW design variations: a typical SW design; an SW design with multiple clusters crossing over per period to achieve balanced cluster sizes at each step; hierarchical randomization to account for higher-level clustering effects; nested substudies to measure outcomes requiring a smaller sample size than the primary outcomes; and hybrid SW design, which combines parallel cluster with SW design to improve efficiency. We also reviewed 3 incomplete SW design variations in which data are collected in some but not all steps to ease measurement burden. These include designs with a learning period that improve fidelity to the intervention, designs with reduced measurements to minimize collection burden, and designs with early and late blocks to accommodate cluster readiness. Variations in SW design offer pragmatic solutions to logistical challenges but have implications to statistical power. Advantages and disadvantages of each variation should be considered before finalizing the design of an SW randomized controlled trial.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

When heart failure develops in patients with type 2 diabetes, prognosis is ominous, highlighting the need for glucose-lowering therapies that can prevent heart failure, improve outcomes, or both. Prior to 2008, there was a paucity of randomized controlled trials evaluating long-term cardiovascular outcomes with glucose-lowering therapies. This changed after guidance on the assessment of novel glucose-lowering agents was issued by both the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. Since then, significant progress has been made as a result of large cardiovascular outcomes trials. Though randomized controlled trials on insulin, sulfonylureas, and metformin are still limited, cardiovascular outcomes trials on newer glucose-lowering agents have included hundreds of thousands of patients with multiple years of follow-up. The increased risk of thiazolidinediones on heart failure had been well theorized and is now established; however, the increase in heart failure hospitalization with certain dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors was unexpected. The reasons for discrepancies with regard to heart failure risk with different dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors remain unclear, and further mechanistic studies are ongoing. The role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists among patients with heart failure also remains unclear, and their effects may differ in patients with and without established heart failure, particularly those with decompensated heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We sought to evaluate geographic variation in treatment and outcomes among these patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 14,671 participants in the Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin (TECOS), those with HF at baseline and a documented ejection fraction (EF) (N = 1591; 10.8%) were categorized by enrollment region (North America, Latin America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and Asia Pacific). Cox models were used to examine the association between geographic region and the primary outcome of all-cause mortality (ACM) or hospitalization for HF (hHF) in addition to ACM alone. Analyses were stratified by those with EF <40% or EF ≥40%. The majority of participants with HF were enrolled in Eastern Europe (53%). Overall, 1,267 (79.6%) had EF ≥40%. β-Blocker (83%) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (86%) use was high across all regions in patients with EF <40%. During a median follow-up of 2.9 years, Eastern European participants had lower rates of ACM/hHF compared with North Americans (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.32-0.64). These differences were seen only in the EF ≥40% subgroup and not the EF <40% subgroup. ACM was similar among Eastern European and North American participants (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.44-1.45). CONCLUSIONS: Significant variation exists in the clinical features and outcomes of HF patients across regions in TECOS. Patients from Eastern Europe had lower risk-adjusted ACM/hHF than those in North America, driven by those with EF ≥40%. These data may inform the design of future international trials.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Nineteen studies (9 randomized control trials [RCTs] and 10 observational studies) with a total of 19,280 patients were included. During a mean follow-up duration of 15 months, torsemide was associated with a numerically lower risk of hospitalization due to heart failure (10.6% vs 18.4%; odds ratio [OR] 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.51, 1.03], p = 0.07, I2 = 18%; number needed to treat [NNT] = 23) compared with furosemide.

There are currently no tools available which enable the holistic assessment of NMS in RLS in clinical practice. The primary aim of this study was to systematically assess NMS prevalence and burden in patients with RLS using the NMS Questionnaire (NMSQuest) validated for Parkinson's disease. Methods: Patients with idiopathic RLS according to the criteria of the international RLS study group (IRLSSG) were included. Patients underwent a physical examination and clinical interview as well as completed the NMS Questionnaire and the international restless legs syndrome study group (IRLSSG) rating scale. Results: Seventy-four patients with primary RLS were included (mean age 64.6 ± 14.4 years, 62.2% female, mean disease duration 23.5 ± 17.8 years, mean Levodopa equivalent daily dose 63.3 ± 67.4 mg). On average patients reported an IRLSSG rating scale score of 24.8 ± 8.2 (maximum 40) and NMSQuest score of 9.9 ± 5.0 (maximum 30). Patients reported a minimum of two NMS with the majority (39.2%) reporting a moderate NMS burden, followed by severe (28.4%) and very severe (17.6%) burden. The most frequent NMS were insomnia (89.2%) followed by nocturia (70.3%), feeling sad (59.5%), forgetfulness (54.1%), urgency (47.3%), feeling anxious (43.2%), unexplained pain (41.9%), difficulty concentrating (40.5%) and dizziness (40.5%). There were no significant differences in NMSQuest total scores according to disease duration and gender (p = 0.739, p = 0.849).

F. Lang and B. J. Fowers (see record 2018-24691-001). In Lang and Fowers' (2019) article, they provide multiple arguments for why dementia caregiving persists despite the seemingly great evolutionary risk. Adding to their list of considerations, the current commentary provides another potential explanation, namely, that individuals may enact dementia caregiving because it provides engagement toward purposeful aims. Having a sense of purpose predicts multiple evolutionary benefits, including greater longevity, and we discuss here 2 routes by which dementia caregiving may fulfill the role of purposeful engagement. First, it provides a mechanism for suiting some individuals' broader goals of helping others in need.

This study explored the effectiveness of the individualized Meeting Centers Support Program (iMCSP) consisting of DemenTalent (people with dementia work as volunteers in a society based on their talents), Dementelcoach (telephone coaching), and STAR e-Learning for caregivers, compared to regular MCSP and No day care support.\nMETHOD:\nAn explorative randomized controlled trial with pre/post measurements (M0-M6) and two groups (iMCSP and regular MCSP). In addition, a comparison was made between iMCSP and a reference No day care control group. Standardized questionnaires were administered on self-esteem, neuropsychiatric symptoms, experienced autonomy and quality of life of the person with dementia, and on caregiver's sense of competence, quality of life, and happiness.\nRESULTS:\nThe iMCSP interventions resulted in a broader group of participants utilizing the Meeting Centers. Compared to regular MCSP, DemenTalent had a moderate positive effect on neuropsychiatric symptoms, which also proved less severe. Positive affect of participants improved within the DemenTalent and regular MCSP group after six months. Caregivers of DemenTalent participants experienced less emotional impact of neuropsychiatric symptoms. No differences were found in experienced burden, sense of competence, or quality of life in caregivers using iMCSP or regular MCSP. Compared to those receiving No day care support, caregivers of DemenTalent participants and caregivers using Dementelcoach or STAR e-Learning proved happier. Post-hoc analyses, accounting for potential between-group differences in outcome measures at baseline, generally showed results in the same direction. People with dementia and caregivers highly appreciated iMCSP and regular MCSP.\nCONCLUSION:\niMCSP can be effectively applied as alternative or additional support via regular Meeting Centers for people with dementia and caregivers who prefer individualized activities/support. DemenTalent decreased the severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms of people with dementia and emotional burden of caregivers. All iMCSP interventions tended to result in caregivers being happier compared to those receiving no support.

A cross-sectional observational study carried out in Almeria's Healthcare District (Spain). A total of 255 family caregivers (42.4% cared for people with mild Alzheimer's disease and 57.6% cared for people with moderate Alzheimer's disease) participated in the study from January to December 2015. Mainly, caregivers were women (81.5% in the mild Alzheimer's disease group and 88.4% in the moderate Alzheimer's disease group), and their average age was 56.54 years (standard deviation (SD) = 13.13) and 54.47 years (SD = 11.71), respectively. Around 47% of the caregivers had been caring for the person with Alzheimer's between two and five years. The Goldberg General Health Questionnaire was used to measure perceived health and the presence of new-onset mental health problems. An exploratory descriptive analysis and a multivariate logistic regression analysis were conducted. For caregivers of people with mild Alzheimer's disease, 'perceived health' was related to 'perceived social support' (r = -0.21; p = 0.028), 'person's level of dependency' (r = -0.24, p = 0.05), 'severity of the person's neuropsychiatric symptoms' (r = 0.22; p = 0.05), and 'caregiver's emotional distress in response to the person's neuropsychiatric symptoms' (r = 0.22; p = 0.05).

The aim of this study was to determine whether specific neuropsychiatric disturbances in people with Alzheimer disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) differentially impact carer distress.\nMETHODS:\nThis was a cross-sectional study of people diagnosed with AD and DLB and their primary carers. The Relatives' Stress Scale (RSS) was used to assess the level of reported distress in carers, and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was used to assess NPSs. The effect of NPSs on carer distress was analyzed using correlation analysis and partial least squares regression.\nRESULTS:\nThis study included 159 participants diagnosed with AD (n = 97) and DLB (n = 62) and their primary carers (spouses and adult children).

While cardiac injury has been demonstrated in critically ill COVID-19 patients, the mechanism of injury remains unclear.

Development of new onset myocardial injury during COVID-19 also increases mortality. While limited data exist, potential mechanisms of cardiac injury include direct viral entry through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and toxicity in host cells, hypoxia-related myocyte injury, and immune-mediated cytokine release syndrome. Potential treatments for reducing viral infection and excessive immune responses are also discussed.

Among cardiovascular diseases, the largest single cause of death is ischemic heart disease. Ischemic heart disease typically manifests as progressive constriction of the coronary arteries, which obstructs blood flow to the heart and can ultimately lead to myocardial infarction. This adversely affects the structure and function of the heart. Conventional treatments lack the ability to treat the myocardium lost during an acute myocardial infarction. Stem cell therapy offers an excellent solution for myocardial regeneration. Stem cell sources such as adult stem cells, embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells have been the focal point of research in cardiac tissue engineering. However, cell survival and engraftment post-transplantation are major limitations that must be addressed prior to widespread use of this technology. Recently, biomaterials have been introduced as 3D vehicles to facilitate stem cell transplantation into infarct sites. This has shown significant promise with improved cell survival after transplantation. In this review, we discuss the various injectable hydrogels that have been tried in cardiac tissue engineering.

The influence of overweight and obesity as risk factors in the development of treatment-related cardiotoxicity in breast cancer (BC) was recently suggested. However, due to meta-analysis design, it was not possible to take into account associated cardiac risk factors or other classic risk factors for anthracycline (antineoplastic antibiotic) and trastuzumab (monoclonal antibody) cardiotoxicity.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS:\nUsing prospective data collected from 2012-2014 in the French national multicenter prospective CANTO (CANcer TOxicities) study of 26 French cancer centers, we aimed to examine the association of body mass index (BMI) and cardiotoxicity (defined as a reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] > 10 percentage points from baseline to LVEF < 50%). In total, 929 patients with stage I-III BC (mean age 52 ± 11 years, mean BMI 25.6 ± 5.1 kg/m2, 42% with 1 or more cardiovascular risk factors) treated with anthracycline (86% epirubicin, 7% doxorubicin) and/or trastuzumab (36%), with LVEF measurement at baseline and at least 1 assessment post-chemotherapy were eligible in this interim analysis. We analyzed associations between BMI and cardiotoxicity using multivariate logistic regression. At baseline, nearly 50% of the study population was overweight or obese. During a mean follow-up of 22 ± 2 months following treatment completion, cardiotoxicity occurred in 29 patients (3.2%). The obese group was more prone to cardiotoxicity than the normal-weight group (9/171 versus 8/466; p = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, obesity (odds ratio [OR] 3.02; 95% CI 1.10-8.25; p = 0.03) and administration of trastuzumab (OR 12.12; 95% CI 3.6-40.4; p < 0.001) were independently associated with cardiotoxicity. Selection bias and relatively short follow-up are potential limitations of this national multicenter observational cohort.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nIn BC patients, obesity appears to be associated with an important increase in risk-related cardiotoxicity (CANTO, ClinicalTrials.gov registry ID: NCT01993498).\nTRIAL REGISTRATION:\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT01993498.", "authors": ["Kaboré EG", "Guenancia C", "Vaz-Luis I", "Di Meglio A", "Pistilli B", "Coutant C", "Cottu P", "Lesur A", "Petit T", "Dalenc F", "Rouanet P", "Arnaud A", "Arsene O", "Ibrahim M", "Wassermann J", "Boileau-Jolimoy G", "Martin AL", "Lemonnier J", "André F", "Arveux P"], "title": "Association of body mass index and cardiotoxicity related to anthracyclines and trastuzumab in early breast cancer: French CANTO cohort study."}, {"references": null, "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6940915/", "publication": "Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Dec 12;20(24). pii: E6273. doi: 10.3390/ijms20246273.", "topic": "Heart Diseases", "abstract": "Abstract\nSphingolipids are key signaling molecules involved in the regulation of cell physiology.

Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), one of their main representatives, is involved in regulating cardiomyocyte homeostasis in different models of experimental cardiomyopathy. Cardiomyopathy is a common complication of diabetes mellitus and represents a main risk factor for heart failure. Notably, plasma concentration of S1P, particularly high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-bound S1P, may be decreased in patients with diabetes mellitus, and hence, inversely related to cardiac alterations. Despite this, little attention has been given to the circulating levels of either total S1P or HDL-bound S1P as potential biomarkers of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Thus, this review will focus on the potential role of HDL-bound S1P as a circulating biomarker in the diagnosis of main cardiometabolic complications frequently associated with systemic metabolic syndromes with impaired insulin signaling.

Furthermore, cell delivery methods involve the administration of stem cells without pre-differentiation, and without consideration for the consequent process of cardiac development. Interestingly, in-vitro studies have demonstrated that the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into cardiomyocytes imitates the stages of cardiogenesis. Wnt signaling plays a profound role during the earliest stages of cardiogenesis and cardiac differentiation. In fact inappropriate Wnt signaling is associated with numerous cardiac disorders especially congenital heart disease. Furthermore, cell-extracellular matrix interactions were shown to be critical for stem cell differentiation and adequate cardiogenesis. Since extracellular matrix molecules are fundamental for maintenance and repair during heart disease and congenital heart disease, they may offer a novel approach for therapy.

This analysis had the purpose of adding further evidence on this issue based on a large population study. Materials and Methods: Forty-five Italian population samples for a total of 25,272 men and 21,895 women, free from cardiovascular diseases, were examined with measurement of some risk factors. During follow-up, CHD deaths were those manifested as myocardial infarction, other acute ischemic attacks, and sudden death of probable coronary origin, after reasonable exclusion of other causes. Cases of HDUE were those manifested only as heart failure, chronic arrhythmia, and blocks in the absence of typical coronary syndromes. Cox proportional hazards models were computed separately for CHD and HDUE, with 11 risk factors as possible predictors. Results: During an average of 7.4 years (extremes 1-16) there were 223 CHD and 150 HDUE fatal events. Male sex, age, smoking habits, systolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and plasma glucose were significantly and directly related to CHD events, while high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was so in an inverse way. The same risk factors were predictive of HDUE events except serum cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. Multivariable hazards ratio of serum cholesterol (delta = 1 mmol/L) was higher in the CHD model (1.24, 95% CI 1.11-1.39) than in the HDUE model (1.03, 0.5% C.I. 0.89-1.19) and the difference between the respective coefficients was statistically significant (p = 0.0444). Age at death was not different between the two end-points.

Depending on the class of pesticides, the specific substances may have a specific set of adverse effects on humans, especially in cases of acute poisoning. In past years, evidence regarding sequelae of chronic, low-level exposure has been accumulating. Cognitive impairment and dementia heavily affect a person's quality of life and scientific data has been hinting towards an association between them and antecedent chronic pesticide exposure. Here, we reviewed animal and human studies exploring the association between pesticide exposure, cognition and dementia. Additionally, we present potential mechanisms through which pesticides may act neurotoxically and lead to neurodegeneration. Study designs rarely presented homogeneity and the estimation of the exposure to pesticides has been most frequently performed without measuring the synergic effects and the possible interactions between the toxicants within mixtures, and also overlooking low exposures to environmental toxicants. It is possible that a Real-Life Risk Simulation approach would represent a robust alternative for future studies, so that the safe exposure limits and the net risk that pesticides confer to impaired cognitive function can be examined. Previous studies that evaluated the effect of low dose chronic exposure to mixtures of pesticides and other chemicals intending to simulate real life exposure scenarios showed that hormetic neurobehavioral effects can appear after mixture exposure at doses considered safe for individual compounds and these effects can be exacerbated by a coexistence with specific conditions such as vitamin deficiency. However, there is an overall indication, derived from both epidemiologic and laboratory evidence, supporting an association between exposure to neurotoxic pesticides and cognitive dysfunction, dementia and Alzheimer's disease.\nCopyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Over 50 loci are now implicated for AD, suggesting that AD is a disease of multiple components, as supported by pathway analyses (immunity, endocytosis, cholesterol transport, ubiquitination, amyloid-β and tau processing). Over 50% of late-onset AD heritability has been captured, allowing researchers to calculate the accumulation of AD genetic risk through polygenic risk scores. A polygenic risk score predicts disease with up to 90% accuracy and is an exciting tool in our research armory that could allow selection of those with high polygenic risk scores for clinical trials and precision medicine. It could also allow cellular modelling of the combined risk. Here we propose the multiplex model as a new perspective from which to understand AD.

Rare cases of early-onset familial Alzheimer's diseases are caused by high-penetrant mutations in genes coding for amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1, and presenilin 2.

Baseline fMRI was compared to those of 25 healthy controls (HCs). The main clinical endpoint was the tremor score (sum of severity, duration, and incapacitation subscores) adapted from the Rating Scale for Psychogenic Movement Disorders (PMDRS) assessed by a blinded clinician. CBT responders were defined as those with PMDRS score reduction >75%. Anatomic and functional brain images were obtained with a 4T MRI system. Generalized linear model and region-of-interest analyses were used to evaluate before-versus-after treatment-related changes in brain activation.\nRESULTS:\nCBT markedly reduced tremor severity (p < 0.01) with remission/near remission achieved in 73.3% of the cohort. Compared to HCs, in those with FT, a functionally defined fMRI region of interest in the anterior cingulate/paracingulate cortex showed increased activation at baseline and decreased activation after CBT during basic-emotion processing (p = 0.012 for CBT responders). Among CBT responders, the change in anterior cingulate/paracingulate was more significant in those with more severe baseline depression (r = 0.75, p < 0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nTremor severity improved significantly after CBT.

In two patients, the electrodes were externalized to determine the effectiveness of caudal zona incerta as a target. Surface EMG (leg muscles), EEG (leg motor cortex) and caudal zona incerta local field potential recordings were recorded. Data were recorded in sitting and standing positions with stimulation OFF and ON.\nRESULTS:\nEMG frequency analysis showed tremor frequency at 13-17 Hz. EMG-EEG coherence was found in the tremor frequency band and double tremor frequency band. EMG-caudal zona incerta coherence was higher in the tremor frequency band, while EEG coherence was higher in the double tremor frequency band. Upon stimulation, there was a selective reduction in tremor frequency band EEG-EMG coherence in all patients.

A movement disorder specialist reviewed the complete medical records of each individual to confirm the presence of parkinsonism, determine the type of synucleinopathy, and identify the onset dates of each cardinal symptom (tremor at rest, bradykinesia, rigidity, and impaired postural reflexes). We determined the median time from age at diagnosis to death or censoring (June 30, 2015) for each presenting symptom and the age- and sex-adjusted risk of death.\nRESULTS:\nFrom 1991 through 2010, a total of 433 individuals had a synucleinopathy diagnosed (301 [69.5%], Parkinson disease; 68 [15.7%], dementia with Lewy bodies; 52 [12.0%], Parkinson disease dementia; and 12 [2.8%], multiple systems atrophy with parkinsonism). Overall, the risk of death in the tremor-predominant group was less than that in the bradykinesia/rigidity-only group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40-0.87; P=.007). Similarly, risk of death in the bradykinesia/rigidity-only group was significantly greater than in the tremor-predominant group (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.23-2.51; P=.002) and compared with tremor before bradykinesia (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.24-2.47; P=.001).\nCONCLUSION:\nPatients with tremor as a presenting symptom have longer survival.

Consequently, the diagnosis of tremor disorders can be challenging, and misdiagnoses are common. The goal of this article is to provide the reader with straightforward approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of tremors.\nRECENT FINDINGS:\nFocused ultrasound thalamotomy of the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus is an emerging and promising therapy for the treatment of essential tremor.\nSUMMARY:\nThe evaluation should start with a detailed tremor history followed by a focused neurologic examination, which should attend to the many subtleties of tremor phenomenology. Among other things, the history and examination are used to establish whether the primary tremor is an action tremor (ie, postural, kinetic, or intention tremor) or a resting tremor. The clinician should then formulate two sets of diagnoses: disorders in which action tremor is the predominant tremor versus those in which resting tremor is the predominant tremor. Among the most common of the former type are essential tremor, enhanced physiologic tremor, drug-induced tremor, dystonic tremor, primary writing tremor, orthostatic tremor, and cerebellar tremor.

Tremor is characterized by rhythmic oscillatory movements while myoclonic jerks are usually arrhythmic. Tremor can be classified into subtypes including the most common types: essential, enhanced physiological, and parkinsonian tremor. Myoclonus classification is based on its anatomic origin: cortical, subcortical, spinal, and peripheral myoclonus. The clinical presentations are unfortunately not always classic and electrophysiologic investigations can be helpful in making a phenotypic diagnosis. Video-polymyography is the main technique to (sub)classify the involuntary movements. In myoclonus, advanced electrophysiologic testing, such as back-averaging, coherence analysis, somatosensory-evoked potentials, and the C-reflex can be of additional value. Recent developments in tremor point toward a role for intermuscular coherence analysis to differentiate between tremor subtypes. Classification of the movement disorder based on clinical and electrophysiologic features is important, as it enables the search for an etiological diagnosis and guides tailored treatment.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Patients who are refractory to medical management can explore surgical intervention. Deep-brain stimulation (DBS) and radiofrequency thalamotomy (RFT) are surgical procedures for intractable tremor that target the ventralis intermedius (VIM) nucleus to relieve contralateral tremor. For patients who are not candidates for surgical procedures, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a minimally invasive management option for tremor relief. SRS has been used for the elderly, those considered high surgical risk for other surgical procedures, those who are unresponsive to either DBS or RFT, and those who prefer a less invasive option. Radiosurgical thalamotomy is performed using a central dose of 130-140 Gy delivered to the VIM nucleus of the thalamus. The critical aspect of the dose planning procedure is the selection of the target, which requires a neurosurgeon experienced with movement disorder surgery. More than 90% of patients experience improvements in their tremor and quality of life after radiosurgical thalamotomy. Adverse radiation effects rates are low (4%). In selected cases, staged bilateral procedure can also be performed to relieve bilateral refractory tremor. In patients with tremor-predominant Parkinson's disease, VIM thalamotomy is also effective.\n© 2019 S.

Measures of 24-hour urinary sodium, 24-hour urinary potassium, blood pressure and participants' use of salt substitute were recorded, with differences between intervention and control groups estimated using generalized linear mixed models. The primary outcome of annual event rate in the two groups combined was determined by dividing confirmed fatal and non-fatal strokes by total follow-up time in the first 2 years. The mean differences (95% CI) were -0.32 g (-0.68 to 0.05) for 24-hour urinary sodium, +0.77 g (+0.60 to +0.93) for 24-hour urinary potassium, -2.65 mmHg (-4.32 to -0.97) for systolic blood pressure and +0.30 mmHg (-0.72 to +1.32) for diastolic blood pressure. Use of salt substitute was reported by 97.5% in the intervention group versus 4.2% in the control group (P<.0001). The overall estimated annual event rate for fatal and non-fatal stroke was 3.2%. The systolic blood pressure difference and the annual stroke rate were both in line with the statistical assumptions underlying study design. The trial should be well placed to address the primary hypothesis at completion of follow-up.\nCopyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

A total of 302 patients with hypertension despite taking at least 1 antihypertensive medication, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and plans for ablation were enrolled from April 2013 to March 2018. Follow-up concluded in March 2019.\nINTERVENTIONS:\nPatients were randomized to either pulmonary vein isolation alone (n = 148) or pulmonary vein isolation plus renal denervation (n = 154). Complete pulmonary vein isolation to v an end point of elimination of all pulmonary vein potentials; renal denervation using an irrigated-tip ablation catheter delivering radiofrequency energy to discrete sites in a spiral pattern from distal to proximal in both renal arteries.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:\nThe primary end point was freedom from atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia at 12 months. Secondary end points included procedural complications within 30 days and blood pressure control at 6 and 12 months.\nRESULTS:\nOf the 302 randomized patients (median age, 60 years [interquartile range, 55-65 years]; 182 men [60.3%]), 283 (93.7%) completed the trial. All successfully underwent their assigned procedures. Freedom from atrial fibrillation, flutter, or tachycardia at 12 months was observed in 84 of 148 (56.5%) of those undergoing pulmonary vein isolation alone and in 111 of 154 (72.1%) of those undergoing pulmonary vein isolation plus renal denervation (hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.85; P = .006). Of 5 prespecified secondary end points, 4 are reported and 3 differed between groups.

Although various interventions for hypertension exist, case management in Brazil's primary healthcare is understudied. We examined nursing case management effectiveness for controlling blood pressure among Brazilian adults with hypertension in the public healthcare system.\nMETHOD:\nA randomized controlled trial with a 12-month follow-up was conducted at a primary healthcare clinic in southern Brazil. Adult patients with hypertension were randomly allocated to intervention (n = 47) and usual care groups (n = 47). The nursing case management model includes nursing consultations, telephone contact, home visits, health education, and appropriate referrals. Patient outcomes (blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, quality of life, treatment adherence) were assessed at baseline and 6- and 12-month follow-up for the intervention group and at baseline and 12-month follow-up for the usual care group. Data were collected from only the intervention group at T6 to avoid contact between the researcher and the usual care group, and to check the care plan and modify it if necessary.\nRESULTS:\nAfter the intervention, the intervention group's blood pressure decreased significantly compared to the usual care group. The differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure between the groups was -8.3 (intervention)/1.1 (usual care) mmHg (p = .004) and -7.4/-0.6 mmHg (p = .007), respectively. The intervention group had significantly greater improvement in waist circumference (-2.0/1.2 cm), body mass index (- 0.4/0.3), and treatment adherence (4.8/-1.1) than the usual care group (all p < .05).\nCONCLUSION:\nNursing case management in primary healthcare may be effective for improving outcomes among patients with hypertension.\n© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "authors": ["Mattei da Silva ÂT", "de Fátima Mantovani M", "Castanho Moreira R", "Perez Arthur J", "Molina de Souza R"], "title": "Nursing case management for people with hypertension in primary health care: A randomized controlled trial."}, {"references": null, "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2019.10.004", "publication": "Am J Med. 2020 Feb;133(2):165-169. doi: 10.1016/j.amjmed.2019.10.004.

There are no guidelines and few recommendations to help inpatient providers manage patients with elevated blood pressure.

This review also found no evidence that asymptomatic elevated blood pressure progresses to lead to end-organ damage.

In the intervention group, phenylephrine was administered intravenously to increase systolic blood pressure (SBP) up to 200 mm Hg. The primary efficacy endpoint was early neurologic improvement (reduction in NIH Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score of ≥2 points during the first 7 days).

Yet, it has been linked with potentially limiting cardiotoxicity, including emerging reports of profound hypertension (HTN). The long-term incidence, severity, and impact of HTN development with ibrutinib are unknown. Therefore, in 562 consecutive patients treated with ibrutinib for B-cell malignancies from 2009 through 2016, we assessed the new/incident or worsened HTN (systolic blood pressure [BP] cutoff, 130 mm Hg). Observed incident HTN rates were compared with Framingham-heart-predicted incident HTN rates. We also evaluated the relationship of HTN to the development of other major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), including arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular death. Further, we assessed the effects of different antihypertensive classes on ibrutinib-related HTN. Overall, 78.3% of ibrutinib users developed new or worsened HTN over a median of 30 months. New HTN developed in 71.6% of ibrutinib users, with a time to 50% cumulative incidence of 4.2 months. Among those without preceding HTN, 17.7% developed high-grade HTN (BP >160/100 mm Hg). In multivariate regression, new or worsened HTN was associated with increased MACEs (hazard ratio [HR], 2.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-4.38). No single antihypertensive class was associated with prevention or control of ibrutinib-related HTN. However, antihypertensive initiation was associated with a lower risk of a MACE (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.24-0.66). Collectively, these data suggest that ibrutinib is associated with a substantial increase in the incidence and severity of HTN, and that HTN development carries a higher risk of subsequent cardiotoxic events.\n© 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.", "authors": ["Dickerson T", "Wiczer T", "Waller A", "Philippon J", "Porter K", "Haddad D", "Guha A", "Rogers KA", "Bhat S", "Byrd JC", "Woyach JA", "Awan F", "Addison D"], "title": "Hypertension and incident cardiovascular events following ibrutinib initiation."}, {"references": null, "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2019.08.028", "publication": "Am J Cardiol. 2019 Dec 1;124(11):1701-1706. doi: 10.1016/j.amjcard.2019.08.028.

We sought to compare ASCVD events by level of PCE-predicted risk among primary and secondary prevention SPRINT populations.

Among 8,151 participants, 16% with previous CVD, mean age was 66 years and 35% were women. The HR for ASCVD events overall was 2.51 (1.96, 3.20).

Patients meeting all eligibility criteria at the final screening visit were stratified by local serum potassium measurement (4·3 to <4·7 mmol/L vs 4·7 to 5·1 mmol/L) and history of diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) with an interactive web response system to receive either placebo or patiromer (8·4 g once daily), in addition to open-label spironolactone (starting at 25 mg once daily) and their baseline blood pressure medications. Participants, the study team that administered treatments and measured blood pressure, and the investigators were masked to assigned treatment groups.

The use of combination pills (also called \"polypills\") containing low doses of medications with proven benefits for the prevention of cardiovascular disease may be beneficial in such persons. However, few data are available regarding the use of polypill therapy in underserved communities in the United States, in which adherence to guideline-based care is generally low.\nMETHODS:\nWe conducted a randomized, controlled trial involving adults without cardiovascular disease. Participants were assigned to the polypill group or the usual-care group at a federally qualified community health center in Alabama. Components of the polypill were atorvastatin (at a dose of 10 mg), amlodipine (2.5 mg), losartan (25 mg), and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg). The two primary outcomes were the changes from baseline in systolic blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level at 12 months.\nRESULTS:\nThe trial enrolled 303 adults, of whom 96% were black. Three quarters of the participants had an annual income below $15,000. The mean estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk was 12.7%, the baseline blood pressure was 140/83 mm Hg, and the baseline LDL cholesterol level was 113 mg per deciliter. The monthly cost of the polypill was $26. At 12 months, adherence to the polypill regimen, as assessed on the basis of pill counts, was 86%. The mean systolic blood pressure decreased by 9 mm Hg in the polypill group, as compared with 2 mm Hg in the usual-care group (difference, -7 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], -12 to -2; P = 0.003).

Despite proven benefits, hypertension control is poor. We hypothesised that a comprehensive approach to lowering blood pressure and other risk factors, informed by detailed analysis of local barriers, would be superior to usual care in individuals with poorly controlled or newly diagnosed hypertension. We tested whether a model of care involving non-physician health workers (NPHWs), primary care physicians, family, and the provision of effective medications, could substantially reduce cardiovascular disease risk.\nMETHODS:\nHOPE 4 was an open, community-based, cluster-randomised controlled trial involving 1371 individuals with new or poorly controlled hypertension from 30 communities (defined as townships) in Colombia and Malaysia. 16 communities were randomly assigned to control (usual care, n=727), and 14 (n=644) to the intervention. After community screening, the intervention included treatment of cardiovascular disease risk factors by NPHWs using tablet computer-based simplified management algorithms and counselling programmes; free antihypertensive and statin medications recommended by NPHWs but supervised by physicians; and support from a family member or friend (treatment supporter) to improve adherence to medications and healthy behaviours. The primary outcome was the change in Framingham Risk Score 10-year cardiovascular disease risk estimate at 12 months between intervention and control participants. The HOPE 4 trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01826019.\nFINDINGS:\nAll communities completed 12-month follow-up (data on 97% of living participants, n=1299). The reduction in Framingham Risk Score for 10-year cardiovascular disease risk was -6·40% (95% CI 8·00 to -4·80) in the control group and -11·17% (-12·88 to -9·47) in the intervention group, with a difference of change of -4·78% (95% CI -7·11 to -2·44, p<0·0001).

Change in blood pressure control status (<140 mm Hg) was 69% in the intervention group versus 30% in the control group (p<0·0001). There were no safety concerns with the intervention.\nINTERPRETATION:\nA comprehensive model of care led by NPHWs, involving primary care physicians and family that was informed by local context, substantially improved blood pressure control and cardiovascular disease risk.

In the intensive treatment group, based on a robust linear mixed model, mean white matter lesion volume increased from 4.57 to 5.49 cm3 (difference, 0.92 cm3 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.14]) vs an increase from 4.40 to 5.85 cm3 (difference, 1.45 cm3 [95% CI, 1.21 to 1.70]) in the standard treatment group (between-group difference in change, -0.54 cm3 [95% CI, -0.87 to -0.20]). Mean total brain volume decreased from 1134.5 to 1104.0 cm3 (difference, -30.6 cm3 [95% CI, -32.3 to -28.8]) in the intensive treatment group vs a decrease from 1134.0 to 1107.1 cm3 (difference, -26.9 cm3 [95% CI, 24.8 to 28.8]) in the standard treatment group (between-group difference in change, -3.7 cm3 [95% CI, -6.3 to -1.1]).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:\nAmong hypertensive adults, targeting an SBP of less than 120 mm Hg, compared with less than 140 mm Hg, was significantly associated with a smaller increase in cerebral white matter lesion volume and a greater decrease in total brain volume, although the differences were small.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION:\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01206062.", "authors": ["SPRINT MIND Investigators for the SPRINT Research Group", "Nasrallah IM", "Pajewski NM", "Auchus AP", "Chelune G", "Cheung AK", "Cleveland ML", "Coker LH", "Crowe MG", "Cushman WC", "Cutler JA", "Davatzikos C", "Desiderio L", "Doshi J", "Erus G", "Fine LJ", "Gaussoin SA", "Harris D", "Johnson KC", "Kimmel PL", "Kurella Tamura M", "Launer LJ", "Lerner AJ", "Lewis CE", "Martindale-Adams J", "Moy CS", "Nichols LO", "Oparil S", "Ogrocki PK", "Rahman M", "Rapp SR", "Reboussin DM", "Rocco MV", "Sachs BC", "Sink KM", "Still CH", "Supiano MA", "Snyder JK", "Wadley VG", "Walker J", "Weiner DE", "Whelton PK", "Wilson VM", "Woolard N", "Wright JT Jr", "Wright CB", "Williamson JD", "Bryan RN"], "title": "Association of Intensive vs Standard Blood Pressure Control With Cerebral White Matter Lesions."}, {"references": null, "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6842688/", "publication": "Am Heart J. 2019 Oct;216:9-19. doi: 10.1016/j.ahj.2019.06.007.

Our aim was to assess impact of CHW based interventions in reducing CVD risk factors in rural households in India.\nMETHODS:\nWe performed an open-label cluster-randomized trial in 28 villages in 3 states of India with the household as a unit of randomization. Households with individuals at intermediate to high CVD risk were randomized to intervention and control groups. In the intervention group, trained CHWs delivered risk-reduction advice and monitored risk factors during 6 household visits over 12 months. Households in the non-intervention group received usual care. Primary outcomes were a reduction in systolic BP (SBP) and adherence to prescribed BP lowering drugs.\nRESULTS:\nWe randomized 2312 households (3261 participants at intermediate or high risk) to intervention (1172 households) and control (1140 households). At baseline prevalence of tobacco use (48.5%) and hypertension (34.7%) were high. At 12 months, there was significant decline in SBP (mmHg) from baseline in both groups- controls 130.3 ± 21 to 128.3 ± 15; intervention 130.3 ± 21 to 127.6 ± 15 (P < .01 for before and after comparison) but there was no difference between the 2 groups at 12 months (P = .18). Adherence to antihypertensive drugs was greater in intervention vs control households (74.9% vs 61.4%, P = .001).\nCONCLUSION:\nA 12-month CHW-led intervention at household level improved adherence to prescribed drugs, but did not impact SBP.

Acute exposure to these environmental factors results in the activation of different signaling pathways that orchestrate adaptive stress responses to maintain cell and tissue homeostasis. Chronic exposure of skin to these factors, however, may lead to the accumulation of damaged macromolecules and loss of cell and tissue integrity, which, over time, may facilitate aging processes and the development of aging-related malignancies. One transcription factor that is expressed in all cutaneous cells and activated by various environmental stressors, including dioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and ultraviolet radiation, is the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). By regulating keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, epidermal barrier function, melanogenesis, and immunity, a certain degree of AHR activity is critical to maintain skin integrity and to adapt to acute stress situations. In contrast, a chronic activation of cutaneous AHR signaling critically contributes to premature aging and the development of neoplasms by affecting metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling, inflammation, pigmentation, DNA repair, and apoptosis.

As NAD+ status is critical in maintaining cellular energy, vitamin B3 deficiency mainly affects tissues that need high cellular energy causing pellagra and skin sun sensitivity. In animal models, NAD+ deficiency leads to UV sensitivity of the skin, impairs DNA damage response, and increases genomic instability and cancer incidence. Furthermore, NAD+ depletion is associated with human skin aging and cancer. NAM prevents the UV-induced ATP depletion boosting cellular energy and enhances DNA repair activity in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, NAM reduces skin cancer incidence and prevents the immune-suppressive effects of UV in mice. Thus, NAM is involved in the maintenance of genomic stability and may have beneficial effects against skin aging changes and tumor development. Clinical studies showed that topical use of NAM reduces cutaneous aging. Furthermore, oral NAM administration reduces the level of UV-mediated immunosuppression and lowers the rate of non-melanoma skin cancers in high-risk patients.

The effects of almond on the skin's lipid barrier and the appearance of wrinkles have not yet been elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of almond consumption on facial sebum production and wrinkles.\nMETHODS:\nThis was a prospective, investigator-blinded, randomized controlled trial in which subjects consumed 20% of their daily energy consumption in either almonds or a calorie-matched snack for 16 weeks. This study was completed at the UC Davis Dermatology clinic. Participants were a volunteer sample of generally healthy postmenopausal females with Fitzpatrick skin types 1 and 2. A facial photograph and image analysis system was used to obtain standardized photographs and information on wrinkle width and severity at 0, 8, and 16 weeks. Measurements of transepidermal water loss and sebum production were also completed at 0, 8, and 16 weeks.\nRESULTS:\nFifty healthy postmenopausal females were recruited, 31 participants were enrolled, and 28 completed the study. Under photographic analysis, the almond group had significantly decreased wrinkle severity and width compared with the control group at 16 weeks (p < .02). Changes in skin barrier function were nonsignificant, measured by the transepidermal water loss (p = .65) between the almond and control groups relative to baseline after 16 weeks. No adverse effects were reported.\nCONCLUSION:\nOur study demonstrates that daily almond consumption may reduce wrinkle severity in postmenopausal females to potentially have natural antiaging benefits.\n© 2019 The Authors.

Fibroblast growth factors (FGF) have elicited studies to evaluate their role of repair and remodeling of the dermis during the skin anti-aging process, since they are regulatory proteins that mediate important signaling pathways and act on cell regeneration and repair processes. FGF acts primarily through binding to tyrosine kinase receptors through the autophosphorylation of their residues, promoting the phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues of specific target proteins such as Raf-1, MAPK/Erk kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1, which are part of the cascade of MAP kinases (mitogen-activated protein kinase). Then, FGF initiate signaling cascades inside the cell, where each kinase activates the following by phosphorylation, resulting in alterations of cellular functions. In addition, the FGF has a relevant role in anti-aging therapy because it is related to collagen and elastin synthesis activation responsible for skin resistance and elasticity, characteristics that are diminished with skin aging. Thus, the present article aims to review several scientific studies that demonstrated the cell signaling involved with the action of FGF on skin aging.\n© 2019 S.

The manner of progression of disease and retinal ganglion cells death in glaucoma still remains unknown and hence many mechanisms are put forward to understand the disease. Clinical developments have suggested that in every single patient decreasing intraocular pressure (IOP) is not the solution to prevent glaucoma which suggests on the fact that there are other risk factors affecting the disease. The demand for substitute unconventional treatments gives rise to the need to understand the biologically based tactics (bio-tactics) for stopping the progression of disease. Pragmatic findings of past years have supported novelty of inventive molecules with hallmark of neuroprotection in gene therapy. On the other hand, transformation of the latest drugs to clinic has not been of much fruitful substantially for the reason that it lacked dependability while measuring in vivo retinal injury. This as a consequence thwarted the high quality healing possibility of neuroprotectants whether administered single-handedly or given complimentary with other IOP reducing agents.

Starting from corneal geometrical properties represented by central corneal thickness (CCT) and continuing with biomechanical properties represented by corneal hysteresis (CH) and corneal resistance factor (CRF) we reviewed the value of investigating corneal properties in ocular hypertension (OH), primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and normal tension glaucoma (NTG) patients. We can now say that CCT plays an important role in diagnosing glaucoma because it may mask the real value of the IOP and also, in setting the target for the IOP needed to stop disease progression. Also, CH is a factor that needs to be screened from the first consult of a glaucoma patient or suspect because it is correlated to the response to treatment, visual field (VF) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) progression and could anticipate the future evolution and patients prognosis.

The major limitation of Goldman applanation tonometer (GAT) is its inability to measure night IOP without disturbing the patient's sleep. We discussed the methods available for the 24-hour IOP monitoring and its relevance in glaucoma. Methods: A PUBMED search was performed using the 24 Hour tonometry, newer tonometry devices, contact lens sensors, as keywords and all relevant articles were studied. Results and Conclusion: A number of methods are available for the 24 hour IOP monitoring. These devices allow home monitoring of IOP without affecting the daily routine. These devices, like Rebound tonometry, Contact lens sensor (CLS), etc., were briefly discussed. Triggerfish is one CLS device that has the capability to measure IOP without affecting the patient's sleep. Besides being safe and easily tolerable, it has shown reproducible results with other tonometry methods. Triggerfish has also been proven the device of choice in measuring IOP in different glaucoma subtypes and determining the efficacy of treatment in them, the only challenge being that it presently provides data on relative IOP rather than absolute IOP. With future research, triggerfish CLS can become an important device to measure the 24 hour IOP values especially in patients whose office measured IOPs seemingly fit in patient's target range but still the patients' disease shows glaucomatous progression. The utility of this device in relation to progressive vision loss is a matter of future study.

Meditation leads to a \"relaxation response\" mediated by nitric oxide with decrease in the stress hormone cortisol, increase in neurotrophins and mitochondrial energy production, and improves the overall quality of life of glaucoma patients.

Because of the different treatment methods, it is significant for clinicians to differentiate the nature of masses. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging has high intrinsic soft-tissue contrast and high spatial and temporal resolution and can provide evidence for differential diagnosis of cardiac masses. However, there is no evidence-based conclusion as to its accuracy. Therefore, the purpose of our study is to perform a systematic review on this issue and provide useful information for clinical diagnosis and treatment.\nMETHODS:\nWe will perform a systematic search in EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PubMed and Web of Science for diagnostic studies using CMR to detect cardiac masses from inception to October, 2019. Two authors will independently screen titles and abstracts for relevance, review full texts for inclusion and conduct detail data extraction. The methodological quality will be assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. If pooling is possible, we will use bivariate model for diagnostic meta-analysis to estimate summary sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio of CMR, as well as different sequences of CMR. Estimates of sensitivity and specificity from each study will be plotted in summary receive operating curve space and forest plots will be constructed for visual examination of variation in test accuracy. If enough studies are available, we will conduct sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis.\nRESULTS:\nThe results of this systematic review and meta-analysis will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.\nCONCLUSION:\nTo our knowledge, this will be the first systematic review on the accuracy of CMR in the differential diagnosis of cardiac masses.

We sought to determine whether an interaction exists between residual platelet reactivity and stent diameter regarding the occurrence of stent thrombosis and other adverse events after PCI. We stratified patients in the prospective ADAPT-DES registry who underwent single-lesion PCI according to if they received a small diameter stent (SDS, defined as a stent with a diameter of 2.25 mm). Patients receiving an SDS were compared with patients receiving a stent ≥2.5 mm using Kaplan-Meier rates and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. We defined major adverse cardiac events (MACE) as the composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis (ST). Among 5,608 patients who underwent single-lesion PCI in ADAPT-DES, 222 (4.0%) patients received an SDS. Patients with an SDS were more likely than patients without an SDS to have 3-vessel disease but received, on average, fewer stents and were less likely to present with a thrombotic lesion. Receiving versus not receiving an SDS was associated with increased risk of ST (adjusted hazard ratio 4.35, 95% confidence interval 1.95 to 9.73, p <0.001) as well as MACE (adjusted hazard ratio 1.75, 95% confidence interval 1.11 to 2.75, p = 0.02). There was no statistical interaction between platelet reactivity and SDS regarding ST (p = 0.12) or MACE (p = 0.51). In conclusion, PCI with small drug-eluting stents is associated with a high risk of thrombotic events, including ST.

Responders (2042) underwent assessment of systolic and diastolic function using echocardiography. The current analyses included all participants with DM and were compared with a group of participants without DM matched 1:2 for age, sex, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. Baseline characteristics and laboratory and echocardiography findings between groups were compared along with rates of mortality due to various cardiovascular conditions.\nRESULTS:\nWe identified 116 participants with DM and 232 matched participants without DM. Those with DM had a higher body mass index and plasma insulin and serum glucose levels. Although left ventricular ejection fractions were similar, E/e' ratio (9.7 vs 8.5; P=.001) was higher in DM vs non-DM. During a follow-up of 10.8 (interquartile range, 7.8-11.7) years, participants with DM had a higher incidence of heart failure (HF); hazard ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence limits, 1.2-3.6; P=.01) and 10-year Kaplan-Meier rate of 21% (22 of 116) vs 12% (24 of 232) compared with those without DM. We also examined the subgroup of participants without diastolic dysfunction. In this subgroup, those with DM had an increased risk for HF; hazard ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence limits, 1.0-6.3; P=.04).\nCONCLUSION:\nIn this cohort, participants with DM have an increased incidence of HF over a 10-year follow-up period even in the absence of underlying diastolic dysfunction. These findings suggest that DM is an independent risk factor for the development of HF and supports the concept of DM cardiomyopathy.\nCopyright © 2019 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Univariate analyses compared patient with and without pretransplant diabetes mellitus (DM). Multivariate regression analyses were conducted to determine association between PTDM and different risk factors. Finally, trends in glucometrics and other outcomes are described across follow-up time points. There were 152 patients who underwent HT between 2010 and 2015, 109 of whom had no pretransplant history of DM. PTDM incidence was 38% by the 1-year follow-up. Pretransplant body mass index (odds ratio [OR] 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 1.23, p = 0.03), insulin use during the final 24 hours of inpatient stay (OR 4.26, 95% CI 1.72 to 10.56, p <0.01), mean inpatient glucose (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.33 to 3.69, p <0.01), and mean glucose in the final 24 hours before discharge (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.60, p = 0.03) were associated with increased odds of PTDM at 1 year.

This analysis improves understanding of PTDM incidence, glucometric trends, and risk differences by DM status in the HT population. Similar to liver and kidney patients, inpatient glucometrics may be informative of PTDM risk in HT patients. Guidelines for this population should be developed to account for risk heterogeneity and need for differential management.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

A total of 1,162 patients were randomized to ZES (169 with diabetes) and 1,170 patients were randomized to SES (168 with diabetes). Patients were further stratified by diabetes status at the time of inclusion. A subgroup of patients with diabetes (n = 88) underwent angiographic re-evaluation 10 months after stent implantation. End points included a combined end point of death or myocardial infarction, and the individual end points of death, myocardial infarction, and revascularization. In patients with diabetes, we found no difference in the combined end point (odds ratio [OR] 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53 to 1.24), death (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.25), or in MI (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.91). However, diabetics with ZES more frequently underwent coronary revascularization compared with SES patients (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.66). In patients without diabetes, ZES and SES had similar 10-year rates of all end points (death: OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.39; MI: OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.05; revascularization: OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.09). Landmark analysis from 5 to 10 years showed no difference in outcomes between SES and ZES in either subgroup. In conclusion, at 10 years, SES and ZES performed similarly in patients with and without diabetes. Although coronary revascularization was more prevalent in diabetes patients with ZES, this may, in part, have been related to the angiographic follow-up that was offered to a subgroup of diabetes patients.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

EMRs continuously accumulate information about patients and make it readily accessible but are limited by missing data or data that are not quality assured. Because EMRs vary in structure and management, comparisons of data between health systems may be difficult. Registries and surveys provide data that are consistently collected and representative of broad populations but are limited in scope and may be updated only intermittently. RCT databases excel in the specificity, completeness, and accuracy of their data, but rarely include a fully representative sample of the general population. Also, they are costly to build and seldom maintained after a trial's end. To consider these issues, and the challenges and opportunities they present, the editors of Diabetes Care convened a group of experts in management of diabetes-related data on 21 June 2018, in conjunction with the American Diabetes Association's 78th Scientific Sessions in Orlando, FL. This article summarizes the discussion and conclusions of that forum, offering a vision of benefits that might be realized from prospectively designed and unified data-management systems to support the collective needs of clinical, surveillance, and research activities related to diabetes.\n© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.", "authors": ["Riddle MC", "Blonde L", "Gerstein HC", "Gregg EW", "Holman RR", "Lachin JM", "Nichols GA", "Turchin A", "Cefalu WT"], "title": "Diabetes Care Editors' Expert Forum 2018: Managing Big Data for Diabetes Research and Care."}, {"references": null, "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjms.2019.08.008", "publication": "Am J Med Sci. 2019 Nov;358(5):326-331. doi: 10.1016/j.amjms.2019.08.008.

It functions by providing the patient with a continuous subcutaneous infusion of a rapid acting insulin and allows the patient to administer boluses throughout the day for food and correction of high glucose levels. CSII is approved in patients with type 1 diabetes and selected patients with type 2 diabetes; however, it is important to select the right patients for pump therapy.

He made anatomy a scientific discipline and is justly considered a precursor of modern orthopaedics. He invented and used several external corrective devices for the treatment of congenital and acquired deformities of the limbs and spinal column, especially those following tubercular infection and rickets, torticollis, vertebral caries kyphosis, scoliosis, and rachitic deformities of the leg, but also congenital dislocation of the hip and congenital club-foot. He ascribed the pathogenesis of the equinovarus supinated foot to the position taken by the foot of the fetus during intrauterine life.

Main outcomes were walking ability (6-minute walk test [6MWT]), muscle strength (manual muscle testing using Medical Research Council [MRC] grading), and pulmonary function (forced vital capacity [FVC] in the upright and supine positions), assessed at 3- to 6-month intervals before and after the start of ERT. Data were analyzed with linear mixed-effects models for repeated measurements.\nRESULTS:\nMedian follow-up duration on ERT was 9.8 years (interquartile range [IQR] 8.3-10.2 years). At the group level, baseline 6MWT was 49% of predicted (IQR 41%-60%) and had deteriorated by 22.2 percentage points (pp) at the 10-year treatment point (p < 0.001). Baseline FVC upright was 54% of predicted (IQR 47%-68%) and decreased by 11 pp over 10 years (p < 0.001). Effects of ERT on MRC sum score and FVC supine were similar. At the individual level, 93% of patients had initial benefit of ERT. Depending on the outcome measured, 35% to 63% of patients had a secondary decline after ≈3 to 5 years. Still, at 10 years of ERT, 52% had equal or better 6MWT and/or FVC upright compared to baseline.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThe majority of patients with Pompe disease benefit from long-term ERT, but many patients experience some secondary decline after ≈3 to 5 years. Individual variation, however, is considerable.\nCLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE:\nThis study provides Class IV evidence that for the majority of adults with Pompe disease, long-term ERT positively affects, or slows deterioration in, muscle strength, walking ability, and/or pulmonary function.\nCopyright © 2019 The Author(s).

In fact, it is one of the main causes of death and disability worldwide, with a negative impact on quality of life for both patient and caregiver. Home automation (also known as domotics) could allow stroke patients to manage and improve their daily lives.\nOBJECTIVE:\nThe aim of our pilot study was to evaluate the effects of domotics on cognitive functions and personal/social autonomy in patients with stroke.\nMETHODS:\nWe enrolled 40 patients affected by chronic stroke undergoing neurorehabilitation at IRCCS Centro Neurolesi (Messina, Italy), between June 2017 and March 2019. All of the patients were randomized into either the control group (undergoing traditional training based on face-to-face interaction between therapist and patient, and practical activities), or the experimental group (undergoing Home Automation training). Each participant was evaluated before and immediately after the training period. Each different training consisted of 3 sessions per week for eight weeks (i.e. a total of 24 sessions), each session lasting about 60 min. For both the conventional and experimental trainings, treatments were performed in groups, and all the patients were provided with the same amount of treatment.\nRESULTS:\nPatients in the experimental group showed a greater improvement in cognitive and social performance, as compared to the control group.\nCONCLUSION:\nOur study shows that domotics could be effective in improving social and cognitive functioning, autonomy and functional recovery in patients affected by chronic stroke.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To date, most available studies are based on treadmill body weight-support (BWS) training and involve patients with chronic stroke sequelae. In contrast, the effects of a BWS training performed on the ground in patients with subacute hemiparesis (stroke within 4 weeks), with significant gait deficiencies, is unknown. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a rehabilitative program that combines conventional approach with an early overground body weight-support training, in terms of recovery of independent walking focussing on patients with subacute stroke. The secondary aim was to evaluate the impact of body weight-support also on functional mobility, overall disability, and gait endurance. A total of 37 participants were enrolled and randomized to experimental group or control group for the baseline evaluations. In the experimental group, body weight-supported overground walking was added to conventional physiotherapy for 4 weeks. The outcome measurements used were: Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC), Rivermead Mobility Index, Barthel Index, and the 6-minute Walk Test. At the evaluation 1 week after the end of the intervention period, experimental group reached a statistically significant increase of independent walking as detected by FAC (experimental group: 3 vs. control group: 2, P < 0.01). No differences were observed by the other evaluation outcome measures.

Those who reported more perceived discrimination had greater risk of severe pain compared to no pain (relative risk [RR]=1.11; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01-1.23; P<.05), mild depressive symptoms (RR=1.09; 95% CI, 1.02-1.17; P<.05), and severe depressive symptoms (RR=1.12; 95% CI, 1.04-1.21; P<.05) compared to no symptoms.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nWheelchair users with SCI who were from more disadvantaged groups (black, lower income levels) reported experiencing more discrimination in their health care setting. Furthermore, those who reported more discrimination were more likely to report worse mental and physical health outcomes.

A bathing adaptation usually involves the removal of a bath or inaccessible shower and replacement with a level, easy access shower. The purpose is to remove the physical environmental barriers and restore older adults' ability to bathe safely and/or independently. The aim of this study was to explore the views and experiences of older adults and their carers who had received a bathing adaptation in order to examine how the adaptation had affected them and identify mechanisms of impact and outcomes from their perspectives. The study was nested within a feasibility Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) (BATH-OUT) conducted within one local authority housing adaptations service in England. Semi-structured interviews were completed between 21 December 2016 and 19 August 2017 with 21 older adults and five carer participants of the feasibility RCT. Interview participants were purposively sampled on living arrangement and gender. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed in seven stages using framework analysis. Findings were presented thematically. Five themes were identified: ease of use; feeling safe; feeling clean; independence, choice and control; and confidence and quality of life. The removal of the physical barriers in the bathroom led to older adults re-mastering the activity of bathing, having an improved sense of physical functioning which gave a sense of 'freedom'. This appeared to impact a range of areas contributing to a wider sense of increased confidence consistent with constructs underpinning social care-related quality of life. We suggest that future research should examine housing adaptations from a person-environment fit approach, and that timely restoration of bathing ability is especially important as it can affect confidence and perceived competence in other areas of daily living.\n© 2019 The Authors.

The iTDS was built as an arch-shaped dental retainer hermetically sealed and placed in the buccal shelf area of the mouth, completely hidden from sight. To provide high level of comfort, the iTDS is customized based on the users' oral anatomy to stably fix onto the lower teeth. We have presented a standalone version of the iTDS, capable of recognizing tongue gestures/commands by processing raw magnetic sensor data with a built-in pattern recognition algorithm in real time. The iTDS then sends the commands out in 10-b packets through a custom-designed high-gain intraoral antenna at 2.4 GHz to an external receiver. To evaluate the standalone iTDS performance, four subjects performed a computer access task by issuing random tongue commands over five sessions. Subjects completed 99.2% of the commands, and achieved an information transfer rate of 150.1 b/min. Moreover, a new typing method, designed specifically for the iTDS, resulted in typing at a rate of 3.76 words/min and error rate of 2.23%.", "authors": ["Kong F", "Sahadat MN", "Ghovanloo M", "Durgin GD"], "title": "A Stand-Alone Intraoral Tongue-Controlled Computer Interface for People With Tetraplegia."}, {"references": null, "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6636953/", "publication": "Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Jun;98(25):e15983. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000015983.", "topic": "Assistive Devices", "abstract": "Abstract\nKnowledge of the patient's own perception of functioning and dependence, and of environmental factors, is of significant value.

PAD was measured using the ankle brachial index (≤0.9). ST was measured using accelerometry. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess associations of quartiles of ST and PAD, and then used the same logistic models with restricted cubic splines to investigate continuous nonlinear associations of ST and PAD. Models were sequentially adjusted for traditional PAD risk factors, leg pain, and moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA).\nRESULTS:\nMedian ST was 12.2 h/d, and 5.4% of individuals had PAD. In fully adjusted restricted cubic splines models accounting for traditional PAD risk factors, leg pain, and MVPA, ST had a significant overall (P = .048) and nonlinear (P = .024) association with PAD. A threshold effect was seen such that time spent above median ST was associated with higher odds of PAD. That is, compared to median ST, 1, 2, and 3 hours above median ST were associated with a PAD odds ratio of 1.16 (95% CI = 1.02-1.31), 1.44 (1.06-1.94), and 1.80 (1.11-2.90), respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nAmong Hispanic/Latino adults, ST was associated with higher odds of PAD, independent of leg pain, MVPA, and traditional PAD risk factors.

Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured using peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), oxygen uptake at the anaerobic threshold (VO2@AT), and maximal power output from cardiopulmonary exercise testing on a bicycle ergometer. Magnetic resonance imaging brain data were analyzed by voxel-based morphometry using regression models with adjustment for age, sex, education, smoking, body weight, systolic blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin level, and intracranial volume.\nRESULTS:\nVolumetric analyses revealed associations of CRF with gray matter (GM) volume and total brain volume. After multivariable adjustment, a 1-standard deviation increase in VO2peak was related to a 5.31 cm³ (95% CI, 3.27 to 7.35 cm³) higher GM volume. Whole-brain voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed significant positive relations between CRF and local GM volumes. The VO2peak was strongly associated with GM volume of the left middle temporal gyrus (228 voxels), the right hippocampal gyrus (146 voxels), the left orbitofrontal cortex (348 voxels), and the bilateral cingulate cortex (68 and 43 voxels).\nCONCLUSION:\nCardiorespiratory fitness was positively associated with GM volume, total brain volume, and specific GM and white matter clusters in brain areas not primarily involved in movement processing.

FRIEND-I data from January 1, 2014, through January 1, 2019, included 11,678 maximal treadmill tests from three countries, whereas the previously published reports included 32,329 maximal treadmill tests from six countries.\nRESULTS:\nFRIEND-I data revealed significant differences between sex and age groups for VO2max (P<0.01). For the 20- to 29-years of age group, the 50th percentile VO2max in men and women were 49.5 mLO2⋅kg-1⋅min-1 and 40.6 mLO2⋅kg-1⋅min-1, respectively. VO2max declined an average of 9% per decade with the 50th percentile for the 70- to 79-years of age group having a VO2max of 30.8 mLO2⋅kg-1⋅min-1 in men and 25.0 mLO2⋅kg-1⋅min-1 in women. These results were similar in magnitude and direction to the previously published literature. Within both the FRIEND-I and previously published data there were CRF differences between countries.\nCONCLUSION:\nThis report begins to establish global reference standards for CRF. Continued development of FRIEND-I will increase global representation providing an improved ability to identify and stratify CRF risk categories.\nCopyright © 2019.

We aimed to test whether biomarkers can reflect CRF and its change over time.\nMETHODS:\nThis post hoc analysis used data from ambulatory cohorts of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (IRONOUT) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (RELAX). Cardiopulmonary exercise testing, 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), and serum biomarkers were measured at baseline and 16- or 24-week follow-up (for IRONOUT and RELAX respectively). Biomarkers included N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), soluble ST2, growth differentiation factor-15, and Galectin-3.\nRESULTS:\nAnalysis included 225 patients with HFrEF and 216 with HFpEF. Baseline peak VO2, VE/VCO2 slope, and 6MWD showed a mild correlation with the doubling of all 4 tested biomarkers in HFrEF and HFpEF. Following multivariable adjustment (including all biomarkers), the only significant association between change in biomarker and functional parameter in HFrEF was change in NT-proBNP and change in VE/VCO2 slope (3.596% increase per doubling, 95% CI 0.779-6.492, P = .012). In HFpEF, a decrease in peak VO2 was associated with an increase in NT-proBNP (-0.726 mL/min/kg per doubling, 95% CI -1.100 to -0.353, P < .001), and a decrease in 6MWD was associated with an increase in growth differentiation factor-15 (-31.606 m per doubling, 95% CI -61.404 to -1.809, P = .038).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nIn these ambulatory trial cohorts, NT-proBNP was associated with baseline and change in CRF in HFrEF and HFpEF. In contrast, novel biomarkers do not appear suitable as a reliable surrogate for serial assessment of exercise capacity in HF patients given lack of consistent independent association with CRF beyond traditional risk factors and NT-proBNP.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION:\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT00763867.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this article we report anecdotal cases of severe complications following penile surgery for ED and PD in high volume centers, describe the strategies adopted to treat it and discuss the options that would have helped preventing these events.\nPATIENTS' CONCERNS:\nThe first case describes a patient with history of ED and PD causing penile shortening and a slight dorsal deviation of penile shaft. In the second case it is described a corporeal necrosis and urethral fistula following inflatable penile prosthesis implant. In the last case it is described the migration of reservoir into the abdomen after inflatable penile prosthesis implantation post-radical prostatectomy.\nDIAGNOSIS:\nAll 3 patients were investigated with a penile doppler ultrasound with PGE1 intracorporeal injection for ED and PD diagnosis. An abdominal computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging were ordered for patient of case three.\nINTERVENTIONS:\nThe patients underwent different combined procedures depending on the case and including: glansectomy, penile prosthesis implantation associated with a penile elongation with double dorsal-ventral patch graft (\"sliding technique\"), penile urethroplasty with buccal mucosa graft, and laparotomy for reservoir removal.\nOUTCOMES:\nNo further serious complications were reported after the procedures described.\nLESSONS:\nPenile surgery in patients with concomitant PD and systemic comorbidities can be at high risk of complications. As shown in this series there are possible dramatic evolution of these complications that may cause irreversible consequences to the patient.

Ejaculatory hood sparing vaporization was performed with preservation of the paracollicular and supracollicular tissue proximal to the verumontanum in 25 patients. Patients were assessed at baseline, and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively using the Ej-MSHQ (Ejaculatory Domain of Male Sexual Health Questionnaire) and the IIEF-15 (International Index of Erectile Function-15).

This case-control study purposed to evaluate the association between prior mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and ED using data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Dataset. In this study, 48,755 patients with ED were identified as cases, and 195,020 propensity score-matched patients without ED were selected as controls. Conditional logistic regressions were conducted to evaluate the odds ratios (ORs) for previous MVP between cases and the matched controls. In all sampled patients, 4,565 (1.87%) patients had MVP before the index date. MVP was found in 1,304 (2.67%) cases and in 3,261 (1.67%) matched controls. Patients with ED had a significantly higher occurrence of MVP than the controls. In addition, after propensity score matching, a conditional logistic regression analysis showed that the OR of previous MVP for patients with ED was 1.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.52 to 1.74) compared to the matched controls. The ORs of previous MVP for patients with ED aged ≤65 years and those >65 years were 1.68 (95% CI 1.56 to 1.81) and 1.49 (95% CI 1.30 to 1.70), respectively, compared with the matched controls. We found that patients with erectile dysfunction had significantly higher odds of previous MVP compared with matched control subjects without ED regardless of the age group.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, knowledge about postural behavior of CIPN patients is sparse. With this pilot study, we used a new approach to i) characterize postural impairments as compared to healthy subjects, ii) allocate possible abnormalities to a set of parameters describing sensorimotor function, and iii) evaluate the effects of a balance-based exercise intervention.\nMETHODS:\nWe analyzed spontaneous and externally perturbed postural control in eight CIPN patients before and after a balance-based exercise intervention by using a modification of an established postural control model. These findings were compared to 15 matched healthy subjects.\nRESULTS:\nSpontaneous sway amplitude and velocity were larger in CIPN patients compared to healthy subjects. CIPN patients' reactions to external perturbations were smaller compared to healthy subjects, indicating that patients favor vestibular over proprioceptive sensory information. The balance-based exercise intervention up-weighted proprioceptive information in patients.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nCIPN patients' major postural deficit may relate to underuse of proprioceptive information that results in a less accurate posture control as spontaneous sway results indicate.

Little is known of the genetic basis of diminished ovarian reserve, while premature ovarian insufficiency often has a genetic basis, with genes affecting various processes. NR5A1 is a key gene required for gonadal function, and variants are associated with a wide phenotypic spectrum of disorders of sexual development, and are found in 0.26-8% of patients with premature ovarian insufficiency. As there is some debate about the extent of involvement of NR5A1 in the pathogenesis of ovarian deficiency, we performed an in-depth analysis of NR5A1 variants detected in a cohort of 142 patients with premature ovarian insufficiency, diminished ovarian reserve, or unexplained infertility associated with normal ovarian function. We identified rare non-synonymous protein-altering variants in 2.8 % of women with ovarian deficiency and no such variants in our small cohort of women with infertility but normal ovarian function. We observed previously reported variants associated with premature ovarian insufficiency in patients with diminished ovarian reserve, highlighting a genetic relationship between these conditions. We confirmed functional impairment resulting from a p.Val15Met variant, detected for the first time in a patient with premature ovarian insufficiency. The remaining variants were associated with preserved transcriptional activity and localization of NR5A1, indicating that rare NR5A1 variants may be incorrectly curated if functional studies are not undertaken, and/or that NR5A1 variants may have only a subtle impact on protein function and/or confer risk of ovarian deficiency via oligogenic inheritance.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Females with Turner syndrome are characterized by skeletal abnormalities, short stature and primary ovarian insufficiency. The aim of this narrative review was to identify the underlying mechanisms of osteoporosis in Turner syndrome, summarize its clinical manifestations and provide suggestions regarding the management of osteoporosis. Girls and women with Turner syndrome have lower bone mineral density and a higher fracture rate than healthy individuals. The most important risk factors for osteoporosis are inadequately treated primary ovarian insufficiency, followed by intrinsic bone abnormalities. Comorbidities that further increase the risk of osteoporosis include vitamin D deficiency, celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, hearing problems can predispose to falls. Early initiation of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) at the age of 11-13 years, prompt titration to the adult dose after 2 years and long-term follow-up to ensure compliance with HRT are the cornerstones of osteoporosis prevention in women with Turner syndrome.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

A minigene assay was performed to validate the effect of the mutation on pre-mRNA splicing.\nRESULTS:\nA novel heterozygous missense mutation in HFM1 (c.3470G > A) associated with POI was identified by whole-exome sequencing. This mutation was heterozygous in the affected family members and was absent in the unaffected family members. In silico analysis predicted that the mutation was potentially pathogenic. Bioinformatic splice prediction tools revealed that the mutation was very likely to have a strong impact on splice site function. Results of the minigene assay revealed that the mutation changed the mRNA splicing repertory.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThe missense mutation of the HFM1 gene (c.3470G > A) may be a cause of POI. The mutation altered mRNA splicing in cells. This study can provide geneticists with deeper insight into the pathogenesis of POI and aid clinicians in making early diagnoses in affected women.", "authors": ["Zhe J", "Chen S", "Chen X", "Liu Y", "Li Y", "Zhou X", "Zhang J"], "title": "A novel heterozygous splice-altering mutation in HFM1 may be a cause of premature ovarian insufficiency."}, {"references": null, "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.maturitas.2019.03.008", "publication": "Maturitas. 2019 May;123:82-88. doi: 10.1016/j.maturitas.2019.03.008.

Women with early menarche and nulliparity or low parity are also at a higher risk of experiencing premature or early menopause. Cigarette smoking (with a strong dose-response effect) and being underweight have been consistently associated with premature and early menopause. Current guidelines for the management of premature and early menopause mainly focus on early initiation of hormone therapy (HT) and continued treatment until the woman reaches the average age at menopause (50-52 years). We suggest that clinicians and health professionals consider the age at menopause of the relevant region or ethnic group as part of the assessment for the timing of HT cessation. In addition, there should be early monitoring of women with a family history of early menopause, who are a child of a multiple pregnancy, or who have had early menarche (especially those who have had no children). As part of preventive health strategies, women should be encouraged to quit smoking (preferably before the age of 30 years) and maintain optimal weight in order to reduce their risk of premature or early menopause.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Increasing data from experimental animal models and epidemiological studies indicate that exposure to a number of ubiquitously distributed reproductively toxic environmental chemicals (RTECs) can contribute to earlier menopause and even premature ovarian failure. However, the causative relationship between environmental chemical exposure and earlier menopause in women remains poorly understood. The present work, is an attempt to review the current evidence regarding the effects of RTECs on the main ovarian activities in mammals, focusing on how such compounds can affect the ovarian reserve at any stages of ovarian development. We found that in rodents, strong evidence exists that in utero, neonatal, prepubescent and even adult exposure to RTECs leads to impaired functioning of the ovary and a shortening of the reproductive lifespan. Regarding human, data from cross-sectional surveys suggest that human exposure to certain environmental chemicals can compromise a woman's reproductive health and in some cases, correlate with earlier menopause. In conclusion, evidences exist that exposure to RTECs can compromise a woman's reproductive health. However, human exposures may date back to the developmental stage, while the adverse effects are usually diagnosed decades later, thus making it difficult to determine the association between RTECs exposure and human reproductive health. Therefore, epidemiological surveys and more experimental investigation on humans, or alternatively primates, are needed to determine the direct and indirect effects caused by RTECs exposure on the ovary function, and to characterize their action mechanisms.", "authors": ["Ge W", "Li L", "Dyce PW", "De Felici M", "Shen W"], "title": "Establishment and depletion of the ovarian reserve: physiology and impact of environmental chemicals."}, {"references": null, "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6398733/", "publication": "BMJ Open. 2019 Feb 21;9(2):e025725. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025725.", "topic": "Menopause", "abstract": "Abstract\nAIMS:\nTo investigate the prevalence, ethnic differences and associated risk factors for pterygium in Han and Manchu populations aged 40-79 years in Hebei province, China.\nDESIGN:\nCross-sectional study, as a part of the China National Health Survey.\nSETTING:\nHebei province, China.\nPARTICIPANTS:\nA multistage cluster sampling method with urbanisation level-based stratification was used to select participants for this study. A total of 4591 individuals over 40 years were recruited for this study. Inclusive criteria: (1) residents who had been living in Hebei for more than 1 year; (2) Han individuals with both parents being Han, or Manchu individuals with both parents being Manchu; (3) underwent ophthalmic examinations and (4) information in the questionnaire was complete.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:\nMultiple logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between pterygium prevalence and factors of interest.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 3790 individuals (2351 Hans and 1439 Manchus) met the study criteria, of which 248 were diagnosed with pterygium (6.5%). There was no significant difference between the prevalence rates in Hans (6.2%) and Manchus (7.2%) (p=0.232).

Our aim was to determine the association between body mass index (BMI) and surgical menopausal symptoms.\nMETHODS:\nWe report a retrospective review of endometrial cancer patients whom underwent menopause secondary to their surgical staging procedure. Symptoms were classified as severe if treatment was prescribed, or mild if treatment was offered, but declined. Univariate analysis was performed with ANOVA and Chi-square tests as appropriate. Relative risks (RR) were generated from Poisson regression models.\nRESULTS:\nWe identified 166 patients in whom the BMI (kg/m2) distribution was as follows: 33 (19.9%) had BMI <30, 49 (29.5%) had BMI 30-39.9, 50 (30.1%) had BMI 40-49.9, and 34 (20.5%) had BMI ≥50.

Hormone therapy (HT) is recommended for women with no contraindications. However, HT is greatly underutilized among these women due to their fear of the associated risks. The objective of this study is to identify and describe determinants of HT uptake and decision-making in women after surgical menopause. Methods We searched Medline, EMBASE, and CINAHL, from inception to April 2018, to identify relevant literature. Inclusion criteria included studies that assessed factors affecting the uptake of HT and decision-making about HT after surgical menopause. Studies including both women with natural and surgical menopause were included. Search terms were derived from 3 main concepts: surgical menopause, hormone therapy, and decision-making. Papers included in the review had to be in the English language and to report human studies. Results Of the 1952 articles identified, 23 were eligible for inclusion. Studies were mostly published before the WHI (61%) and had a quantitative cross-sectional study design. Only 22% focused on surgical menopause per se. The mean age at time of surgical menopause was 43.6 years (range 29-68). HT uptake was associated with younger age, higher level of education, higher income and adopting positive lifestyle behaviors. Factors affecting decision-making were mostly perceptions, beliefs, and values women associate with HT, as well as knowledge of and experiences with HT and surgical menopause. External factors related to physicians' recommendations and information sources also influenced HT decision-making. Conclusion Our review highlights the complex nature of decision-making about HT after surgical menopause and the numerous factors involved. Women tend to rely on subjective perceptions and inferences from information sources, which may hamper the ability to make informed treatment decisions. There is a need for tailored decision-aid interventions to help support women and guide informed treatment decisions.\nCopyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Several reports highlight that PD disturbs also other cells than CNS neurons including PBMCs, which could lead, among other things, to dysfunctions of immune functions. Because autophagy could be altered in PD, a monocentric pilot study was performed to quantify the transcripts levels of several autophagy genes in blood cells. MAP1LC3B, GABARAP, GABARAPL1, GABARAPL2 and P62/SQSTM1 were found to be overexpressed in patients. On the contrary, transcripts for HSPA8 and GAPDH were both decreased. Expression of MAP1LC3B and GABARAP was able to successfully segregate PD patients from healthy controls. The accuracy of this segregation was substantially increased when combined expressions of MAP1LC3B and GAPDH or GABARAP and GAPDH were used as categorical variables. This pilot study suggests that autophagy genes expression is dysregulated in PD patients and may open new perspectives for the characterisation of prediction markers.\nCopyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we aimed to characterise the genetic variation in known and novel PD genes in a group of Black South African and Nigerian patients.\nMETHODS:\nWe recruited 33 Black South African and 14 Nigerian PD patients, and screened them for sequence variants in 751 genes using an Ion AmpliSeq™ Neurological Research panel. We used bcftools to filter variants and annovar software for the annotation. Rare variants were prioritised using MetaLR and MetaSVM prediction scores. The effect of a variant on ATP13A2's protein structure was investigated by molecular modelling.\nRESULTS:\nWe identified 14,655 rare variants with a minor allele frequency ≤ 0.01, which included 2448 missense variants.

Mixed-effects cumulative probability models within a Bayesian framework were used to estimate differences between the treatment groups. The primary outcome of this health-status analysis was the SAQ summary score (scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health status). All analyses were performed in the overall population and according to baseline angina frequency.\nRESULTS:\nAt baseline, 35% of patients reported having no angina in the previous month. SAQ summary scores increased in both treatment groups, with increases at 3, 12, and 36 months that were 4.1 points (95% credible interval, 3.2 to 5.0), 4.2 points (95% credible interval, 3.3 to 5.1), and 2.9 points (95% credible interval, 2.2 to 3.7) higher with the invasive strategy than with the conservative strategy. Differences were larger among participants who had more frequent angina at baseline (8.5 vs. 0.1 points at 3 months and 5.3 vs. 1.2 points at 36 months among participants with daily or weekly angina as compared with no angina).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nIn the overall trial population with moderate or severe ischemia, which included 35% of participants without angina at baseline, patients randomly assigned to the invasive strategy had greater improvement in angina-related health status than those assigned to the conservative strategy. The modest mean differences favoring the invasive strategy in the overall group reflected minimal differences among asymptomatic patients and larger differences among patients who had had angina at baseline.

The first is to undertake a diagnostic study, and the second is to undertake a nested, clinical trial of stratified medicine.\nDESIGN:\nA prospective, multicenter, randomized, blinded, sham-controlled trial of stratified medicine (NCT03477890) will be performed. All-comers referred for clinically indicated CTCA for investigation of suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) will be screened in 3 regional centers. Following informed consent, eligible patients with angina symptoms are enrolled before CTCA and remain eligible if CTCA excludes obstructive CAD. Diagnostic study: Invasive coronary angiography involving an interventional diagnostic procedure (IDP) to assess for disease endotypes: (1) angina due to obstructive CAD (fractional flow reserve ≤0.80); (2) microvascular angina (coronary flow reserve <2.0 and/or index of microvascular resistance >25); (3) microvascular angina due to small vessel spasm (acetylcholine); (4) vasospastic angina due to epicardial coronary spasm (acetylcholine); and (5) noncoronary etiology (normal coronary function). The IDP involves direct invasive measurements using a diagnostic coronary guidewire followed by provocation testing with intracoronary acetylcholine. The primary outcome of the diagnostic study is the reclassification of the initial CTCA diagnosis based on the IDP. Stratified medicine trial: Participants are immediately randomized 1:1 in the catheter laboratory to therapy stratified by endotype (intervention group) or not (control group). The primary outcome of the trial is the mean within-subject change in Seattle Angina Questionnaire score at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include safety, feasibility, diagnostic utility (impact on diagnosis and certainty), and clinical utility (impact on treatment and investigations). Health status assessments include quality of life, illness perception, anxiety-depression score, treatment satisfaction, and physical activity. Participants who are not randomized will enter a follow-up registry. Health and economic outcomes in the longer term will be assessed using electronic patient record linkage.\nVALUE:\nCorCTCA will prospectively characterize the prevalence of disease endotypes in INOCA and determine the clinical value of stratified medicine in this population.\nCopyright © 2019 The Authors.

Unlike the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction which is based on the elevation of cardiac markers, the diagnosis of CAS is difficult and sometimes requires sophisticated and risky provocative test which is not widely accepted in China. There is no well-established biomarker for the diagnosis or prediction of CAS. However, there are some biomarkers proven to be associated with the occurrence of CAS. For example, inflammatory factors including C-reactive protein and cytokines, lipoprotein (a), and cystatin-C might be precipitating factor for CAS. Rho-kinase as a mediator involved in multiple mechanisms of CAS, serotonin, and endothelin-1 as powerful vasoconstrictors leading to vasospasm were all observed being elevated in patients with CAS. Thioredoxin and nitrotyrosine reflected the oxidative status and could be observed to be elevated after the occurrence of CAS. In some cases doubted to be CAS without the evidence of provocative test, the blood test for the biomarkers mentioned above could be useful for the diagnosis of CAS.\nCopyright © 2019 Liang Li et al.", "authors": ["Li L", "Jin YP", "Xia SD", "Feng C"], "title": "The Biochemical Markers Associated with the Occurrence of Coronary Spasm."}, {"references": null, "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6668548/", "publication": "Biomed Res Int. 2019 Jul 18;2019:3026453. doi: 10.1155/2019/3026453. eCollection 2019.", "topic": "Angina", "abstract": "Abstract\nOBJECTIVE:\nThe aim of the study was to establish, by means of linear regressions analysis, whether RANTES and CCL2 have a relationship with age, sex, heart rate, ejection fraction, white blood cells count, monocyte count, platelet count, mean platelet volume, hsCRP concentration, creatinine and eGFR value, applied treatments, and coronary risk factors in polish cardiovascular disease patients.\nMETHODS:\nPlasma chemokines concentrations were measured by ELISA method (R&D Systems Europe Ltd., Abingdon, England) in 115 cardiovascular disease patients (83 myocardial infarction/AMI and 32 stable angina/SA) and in the control group (N=25).\nRESULTS:\nUnivariate linear regression analysis found that (1) for men mean RANTES plasma level is 1.56 times higher as compared to women; (2) if patient's age increases by 1 year, the mean RANTES concentration value increases by 1.4%; (3) if CCL2 concentration increases by 10 pg/mL, the mean RANTES concentration value increases by 3.3%; (4) if hsCRP concentration increases by 1 mg/L, the mean RANTES concentration value increases by 1.0%.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of XNN capsule compared with placebo by clinical trial.\nMETHODS:\nThis multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will be conducted with a total of 240 participants diagnosed with chronic stable angina (qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome). The participants will be randomized (1:1) into groups receiving either XNN or placebo for 12 weeks. After a 2-week run-in period, they will receive either XNN or placebo (3 pills, 3 times daily) for 12 weeks on the basis of conventional therapy. The primary outcomes include changes in the integral scores of angina symptoms. The secondary outcome measures include changes in the total score of traditional Chinese medicine syndrome, severity grading of angina pectoris, the number of angina pectoris per week, nitroglycerin dosage, score of seattle angina scale, serum homocysteine, incidence of cardiovascular events.

The noninferiority margin was a risk difference of 6 percentage points.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 184 of 454 patients (40.5%) in the cardiovascular-MRI group and 213 of 464 patients (45.9%) in the FFR group met criteria to recommend revascularization (P = 0.11). Fewer patients in the cardiovascular-MRI group than in the FFR group underwent index revascularization (162 [35.7%] vs. 209 [45.0%], P = 0.005). The primary outcome occurred in 15 of 421 patients (3.6%) in the cardiovascular-MRI group and 16 of 430 patients (3.7%) in the FFR group (risk difference, -0.2 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -2.7 to 2.4), findings that met the noninferiority threshold. The percentage of patients free from angina at 12 months did not differ significantly between the two groups (49.2% in the cardiovascular-MRI group and 43.8% in the FFR group, P = 0.21).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nAmong patients with stable angina and risk factors for coronary artery disease, myocardial-perfusion cardiovascular MRI was associated with a lower incidence of coronary revascularization than FFR and was noninferior to FFR with respect to major adverse cardiac events.

The management of angina in the elderly is challenging due to drug intolerance and/or drug resistance as well as frailty. Over the past decades, many new therapeutic small molecules have been investigated for the management of angina. Although none of these studies have specifically focused on the therapies for the elderly, they offer promising new avenues for the treatment of angina in the elderly. Areas covered: Herein, the authors provide a review of the recently published literature on the use of small-molecule therapies for angina management in the elderly and provide a brief overview of these therapies. Expert opinion: A variety of therapeutic classes of existing and newer small molecules are emerging for the management of angina in the elderly. An individualized approach to the management of angina in this growing population is critical for good outcomes.

We aimed to investigate whether novel imaging using prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET-CT might improve accuracy and affect management.\nMETHODS:\nIn this multicentre, two-arm, randomised study, we recruited men with biopsy-proven prostate cancer and high-risk features at ten hospitals in Australia. Patients were randomly assigned to conventional imaging with CT and bone scanning or gallium-68 PSMA-11 PET-CT. First-line imaging was done within 21 days following randomisation. Patients crossed over unless three or more distant metastases were identified. The primary outcome was accuracy of first-line imaging for identifying either pelvic nodal or distant-metastatic disease defined by the receiver-operating curve using a predefined reference-standard including histopathology, imaging, and biochemistry at 6-month follow-up. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ANZCTR12617000005358.\nFINDINGS:\nFrom March 22, 2017 to Nov 02, 2018, 339 men were assessed for eligibility and 302 men were randomly assigned. 152 (50%) men were randomly assigned to conventional imaging and 150 (50%) to PSMA PET-CT. Of 295 (98%) men with follow-up, 87 (30%) had pelvic nodal or distant metastatic disease. PSMA PET-CT had a 27% (95% CI 23-31) greater accuracy than that of conventional imaging (92% [88-95] vs 65% [60-69]; p<0·0001). We found a lower sensitivity (38% [24-52] vs 85% [74-96]) and specificity (91% [85-97] vs 98% [95-100]) for conventional imaging compared with PSMA PET-CT. Subgroup analyses also showed the superiority of PSMA PET-CT (area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve 91% vs 59% [32% absolute difference; 28-35] for patients with pelvic nodal metastases, and 95% vs 74% [22% absolute difference; 18-26] for patients with distant metastases). First-line conventional imaging conferred management change less frequently (23 [15%] men [10-22] vs 41 [28%] men [21-36]; p=0·008) and had more equivocal findings (23% [17-31] vs 7% [4-13]) than PSMA PET-CT did. Radiation exposure was 10·9 mSv (95% CI 9·8-12·0) higher for conventional imaging than for PSMA PET-CT (19·2 mSv vs 8·4 mSv; p<0·001). We found high reporter agreement for PSMA PET-CT (κ=0·87 for nodal and κ=0·88 for distant metastases). In patients who underwent second-line image, management change occurred in seven (5%) of 136 patients following conventional imaging, and in 39 (27%) of 146 following PSMA PET-CT.\nINTERPRETATION:\nPSMA PET-CT is a suitable replacement for conventional imaging, providing superior accuracy, to the combined findings of CT and bone scanning.\nFUNDING:\nMovember and Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia.

Biopsies performed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) targeting may reduce the misclassification of prostate cancer in men with MRI-visible lesions.\nMETHODS:\nMen with MRI-visible prostate lesions underwent both MRI-targeted and systematic biopsy. The primary outcome was cancer detection according to grade group (i.e., a clustering of Gleason grades). Grade group 1 refers to clinically insignificant disease; grade group 2 or higher, cancer with favorable intermediate risk or worse; and grade group 3 or higher, cancer with unfavorable intermediate risk or worse. Among the men who underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy, upgrading and downgrading of grade group from biopsy to whole-mount histopathological analysis of surgical specimens were recorded. Secondary outcomes were the detection of cancers of grade group 2 or higher and grade group 3 or higher, cancer detection stratified by previous biopsy status, and grade reclassification between biopsy and radical prostatectomy.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 2103 men underwent both biopsy methods; cancer was diagnosed in 1312 (62.4%) by a combination of the two methods (combined biopsy), and 404 (19.2%) underwent radical prostatectomy. Cancer detection rates on MRI-targeted biopsy were significantly lower than on systematic biopsy for grade group 1 cancers and significantly higher for grade groups 3 through 5 (P<0.01 for all comparisons). Combined biopsy led to cancer diagnoses in 208 more men (9.9%) than with either method alone and to upgrading to a higher grade group in 458 men (21.8%). However, if only MRI-target biopsies had been performed, 8.8% of clinically significant cancers (grade group ≥3) would have been misclassified. Among the 404 men who underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy, combined biopsy was associated with the fewest upgrades to grade group 3 or higher on histopathological analysis of surgical specimens (3.5%), as compared with MRI-targeted biopsy (8.7%) and systematic biopsy (16.8%).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nAmong patients with MRI-visible lesions, combined biopsy led to more detection of all prostate cancers. However, MRI-targeted biopsy alone underestimated the histologic grade of some tumors. After radical prostatectomy, upgrades to grade group 3 or higher on histopathological analysis were substantially lower after combined biopsy.

This amplifies the effect geometric uncertainties have on normal tissue dose. The aim of this study was to determine whether the treatment dose-volume histogram (DVH) agrees with the planned dose to organs at risk (OAR).\nMETHODS:\n41 low-intermediate risk prostate cancer patients were treated with SABR using a linac based technique. Dose prescribed was 35 Gy in five fractions delivered on alternate days, planned using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with 10X flattening filter free (FFF). On treatment, prostate was matched to fiducial markers on cone beam CT (CBCT). OAR were retrospectively delineated on 205 pre-treatment CBCT images. Daily CBCT contours were overlaid on the planning CT for dosimetric analysis. Verification plan used to evaluate the daily DVH for each structure. The daily doses received by OAR were recorded using the D%.\nRESULTS:\nThe median rectum and bladder volumes at planning were 67.1 cm3 (interquartile range 56.4-78.2) and 164.4 cm3 (interquartile range 120.3-213.4) respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in median rectal volume at each of the five treatment scans compared to the planning scan (p = 0.99). This was also the case for median bladder volume (p = 0.79). The median dose received by rectum and bladder at each fraction was higher than planned, at the majority of dose levels. For rectum the increase ranged from 0.78-1.64Gy and for bladder 0.14-1.07Gy. The percentage of patients failing for rectum D35% < 18 Gy (p = 0.016), D10% < 28 Gy (p = 0.004), D5% < 32 Gy (p = 0.0001), D1% < 35 Gy (p = 0.0001) and bladder D1% < 35 Gy (p = 0.001) at treatment were all statistically significant.\nCONCLUSION:\nIn this cohort of prostate SABR patients, we estimate the OAR treatment DVH was higher than planned.

The survey of the literature was last implemented on 1 February, 2019.\nRESULTS:\nTen eligible studies were identified, with a total sample size of n = 33,645, that measured vegetable intake separately from fruit, or combined this with fruit intake. Where studies explored the independent effects of fruit and vegetable consumption on psychological health (n = 3), 2 reported a preferential effect of vegetables (compared with fruit) on psychological well-being, whereas 1 reported a superior effect of fruit intake on odds reduction of symptoms of depression. More broadly, there was evidence that consuming the recommended amount of F&V (and exceeding this) was associated with increased psychological well-being. However, the effects of F&V consumption on mental health symptoms were inconsistent.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nIncreased F&V consumption has a positive effect on psychological well-being and there appears to be a preferential effect of vegetables (compared with fruit) from the limited data examined. The effect of F&V intake on mental health is less clear and, at present, there are no clear data to support a preferential effect of vegetable intake on mental health outcomes. Hence, additional research is warranted to investigate the influence of vegetables, compared with fruit, on psychological health in order to inform nutrition-based interventions.

Study selection was undertaken independently by two reviewers. We used the Wallace criteria and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool to assess the quality of the evidence. We developed a logic model with stakeholders and used this as a framework to guide data extraction and synthesis. Where appropriate, we used meta-analysis to combine effect estimates from quantitative studies.\nRESULTS:\nNineteen studies (10 qualitative, 2 mixed methods and 7 randomised trials) met the inclusion criteria. Interactions with robopets were described as having a positive impact on aspects of well-being including loneliness, depression and quality of life by residents and staff, although there was no corresponding statistically significant evidence from meta-analysis for these outcomes. Meta-analysis showed evidence of a reduction in agitation with the robopet \"Paro\" compared to control (-0.32 [95% CI -0.61 to -0.04, p = 0.03]). Not everyone had a positive experience of robopets.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nEngagement with robopets appears to have beneficial effects on the health and well-being of older adults living in care homes, but not all chose to engage. Whether the benefits can be sustained are yet to be investigated.\nIMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:\nRobopets have the potential to benefit people living in care homes, through increasing engagement and interaction. With the robopet acting as a catalyst, this engagement and interaction may afford comfort and help reduce agitation and loneliness.\n© 2019 The Authors.

The effects of life story work on the psychological well-being of community-dwelling older people were examined in this study.\nDESIGN AND METHODS:\nFor this randomised controlled trial, 244 community-dwelling participants in 17 social centres run by a non-governmental organisation were recruited. The participants were randomly allocated to intervention (n = 124) and control (n = 120) groups. Each member of the intervention group worked with a volunteer to prepare his/her life storybook, while those in the control group participated in a social program. Data were collected at baseline, immediately postintervention, and at three and six months postintervention. The outcomes included measures of life satisfaction, self-esteem, general mental well-being and depressive symptoms.\nRESULTS:\nNo significant interaction effect was observed between the groups over time, except for an improvement in the general mental well-being of the control group at three months postintervention.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nA comparison of the findings in the literature showed that some positive results were reported for LSW studies conducted in nursing homes, whereas in community studies, the results were not always positive. Life story work for seniors in the community did not have the same positive outcomes as previously observed among nursing home residents. It is possible that the intervention had a greater effect on more deprived individuals. Community-dwelling seniors can be encouraged to participate in social activities, which apparently can lead to similar outcomes.\nIMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:\nClinicians should not assume that similar interventions can have similar effects when delivered in a different setting. Community-dwelling seniors can be encouraged to participate in social activities, which can also promote psychological wellbeing similar to to the effects of activities related to life story work.\n© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.", "authors": ["Lai CKY", "Chin KCW", "Zhang Y", "Chan EA"], "title": "Psychological outcomes of life story work for community-dwelling seniors: A randomised controlled trial."}, {"references": null, "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.13047", "publication": "Eur J Cancer Care (Engl). 2019 Jul;28(4):e13047. doi: 10.1111/ecc.13047.

Given the relationship between symptoms of depression and patient-reported outcomes (PROs), adversity in childhood might be associated with PROs in patients seeking care for musculoskeletal problems, but it is not clear whether in fact there is such an association among patients seeking care in an outpatient, upper extremity orthopaedic practice.\nQUESTIONS/PURPOSES:\n(1) Are ACE scores independently associated with variation in physical limitations measured among patients seen by an orthopaedic surgeon? (2) Are ACE scores independently associated with variations in pain intensity? (3) What factors are associated with ACE scores when treated as a continuous variable or as a categorical variable?\nMETHODS:\nWe prospectively enrolled 143 adult patients visiting one of seven participating orthopaedic surgeons at three private and one academic orthopaedic surgery offices in a large urban area. We recorded their demographics and measured ACEs (using a validated 10-item binary questionnaire that measured physical, emotional, and sexual abuse in the first 18 years of life), magnitude of physical limitations, pain intensity, symptoms of depression, catastrophic thinking, and health anxiety. There were 143 patients with a mean age of 51 years, 62 (43%) of whom were men. In addition, 112 (78%) presented with a specific diagnosis and most (n = 79 [55%]) had upper extremity symptoms. We created one logistic and three linear regression models to test whether age, gender, race, marital status, having children, level of education, work status, insurance type, comorbidities, body mass index, smoking, site of symptoms, type of diagnosis, symptoms of depression, catastrophic thinking, and health anxiety were independently associated with (1) the magnitude of limitations; (2) pain intensity; (3) ACE scores on the continuum; and (4) ACE scores categorized (< 3 or ≥ 3). We calculated a priori that to detect a medium effect size with 90% statistical power and α set at 0.05, a sample of 136 patients was needed for a regression with five predictors if ACEs would account for ≥ 5% of the variability in physical function, and our complete model would account for 15% of the overall variability. To account for 5% incomplete responses, we enrolled 143 patients.\nRESULTS:\nWe found no association between ACE scores and the magnitude of physical limitations measured by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function (p = 0.67; adjusted R = 0.55). ACE scores were not independently associated with pain intensity (Pearson correlation [r] = 0.11; p = 0.18). Greater ACE scores were independently associated with diagnosed mental comorbidities both when analyzed on the continuum (regression coefficient [β] = 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32-1.9; standard error [SE] 0.41; p = 0.006) and categorized (odds ratio [OR], 3.3; 95% CI, 1.2-9.2; SE 1.7; p = 0.024), but not with greater levels of health anxiety (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.90-1.3; SE 0.096; p = 0.44, C statistic = 0.71), symptoms of depression (ACE < 3 mean ± SD = 0.73 ± 1.4; ACE ≥ 3 = 1.0 ± 1.4; p = 0.29) or catastrophic thinking (ACE < 3 = 3.6 ± 3.5; ACE ≥ 3 = 4.9 ± 5.1; p = 0.88).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nACEs may not contribute to greater pain intensity or magnitude of physical limitations unless they are accompanied by greater health anxiety or less effective coping strategies. Adverse events can contribute to anxiety and depression, but perhaps they sometimes lead to development of resilience and effective coping strategies. Future research might address whether ACEs affect symptoms and limitations in younger adult patients and patients with more severe musculoskeletal pathology such as major traumatic injuries.\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE:\nLevel II, prognostic study.", "authors": ["Ottenhoff JSE", "Kortlever JTP", "Boersma EZ", "Laverty DC", "Ring D", "Driscoll MD"], "title": "Adverse Childhood Experiences Are Not Associated With Patient-reported Outcome Measures in Patients With Musculoskeletal Illness."}, {"references": null, "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1097/JNC.0000000000000029", "publication": "J Assoc Nurses AIDS Care. 2019 Jan-Feb;30(1):5-14. doi: 10.1097/JNC.0000000000000029.", "topic": "Older Adult Mental Health", "abstract": "Abstract\nThe concept of successful aging was recognized only recently by HIV researchers because people living with HIV (PLWH) in the early epidemic were not expected to survive.

The Wilcoxon signed-ranks test (t test) was used to analyze the data.\nRESULTS:\nHope in addition to cognitive stimulation shows more significant results in elderly people at initial stimulation (0.18), mainly at the permanence and troubleshooting on the paths concerned; this corresponds with the results obtained for hope (0.18). Depressive symptomatology showed significant differences among the 2 groups (0.39 and 0.02). In the between-groups comparisons, only GDS showed significance (0.46).Hope training has an impact on the remission of depressive symptoms and, despite increased hope levels, training was effective for the reduction of depression symptoms for up to 6 months, thereafter only playing a maintenance role. Broadly, hope has been shown to promote elderly people's mental health.", "authors": ["Hartmann JAS Júnior", "Fernandes ALAF", "Medeiros AGAP", "Vasconcelos CAC", "Pinheiro KSCB", "Amorim LLL", "Queiroga MFS", "Cruz MRCD", "Araújo RCT", "Neto MLR"], "title": "Hope as a behavior and cognitive process: A new clinical strategy about mental health's prevention."}]
