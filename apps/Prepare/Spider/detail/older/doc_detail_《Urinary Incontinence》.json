While fall prevention strategies have been historically championed by nurses, hospitalist physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants play a vital role in the multidisciplinary care team in ensuring the safety of our patients. Multiple fall risk assessment tools exist, but no one tool has demonstrated excellence in predicting patient falls in the hospital. Any fall risk assessment tool should be complemented by a clinician's individualized evaluation of patient-specific, situational, and environmental risk factors. A particular emphasis on medication review is critical, as numerous medication classes can increase the risk of falls, and medications are a potentially modifiable risk factor. Multiple studies of individual and multicomponent nursing-based interventions have failed to demonstrate success in reducing falls or fall injuries. Promising strategies for fall prevention include tailoring interventions to patient risk factors and individualized patient education. In addition to nursing-based interventions, the hospitalist's role in fall prevention is to (1) identify and address potentially modifiable risk factors, (2) reinforce individualized education to patients, and (3) advise behavior choices that promote safe mobility. If a patient does sustain a fall, the hospitalist should partner with the multidisciplinary care team in post fall care to assess for injury, evaluate underlying causes of the fall, and determine plans for secondary prevention.", "authors": ["Keuseman R", "Miller D"], "title": "A hospitalist's role in preventing patient falls."}, {"references": null, "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.4088/JCP.TV18059BR2C", "publication": "J Clin Psychiatry. 2020 Jan 28;81(2). pii: TV18059BR2C. doi: 10.4088/JCP.TV18059BR2C.", "topic": "Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage", "abstract": "Abstract\nValbenazine and deutetrabenazine are FDA-approved as treatment for tardive dyskinesia (TD).

Multiple healthcare and service providers are often involved in care, which can result in increased risk of fragmentation of care. Optimal medication therapy management (MTM) is essential to ensure therapeutic benefit from medication regimens. However, little is known about the experiences of providers in supporting persons with SCI/D with MTM.\nMETHODS:\nTelephone interviews were conducted to explore healthcare and service providers' experiences with MTM for persons with SCI/D. Participants were recruited through clinical organizations and researchers' personal contacts. Participants were purposefully selected for diversity in profession and were required to be English speaking and to have provided care to at least one person with SCI/D. The qualitative interviews followed a semi-structured interview guide. Data display matrices were used in a constant comparative process for descriptive and interpretive analysis.\nRESULTS:\nThirty-two interviews were conducted from April to December 2018. Each profession had distinct views on their roles in facilitating MTM for persons with SCI/D, which aligned with their respective scopes of practice. Shared provider tasks included tailoring medications, providing education, and exploring medication alternatives. Most participants felt that the care they provided for persons with SCI/D was similar to the care that they provided to other patients, with some differences relating to the physical limitations and medical complexity associated with SCI/D. Five factors were identified that impacted participants' abilities to provide MTM for persons with SCI/D: patient self-management skills, provider knowledge and confidence, provider-patient relationships, interprofessional collaboration, and provider funding models including the use of technology-supported consultations.\nCONCLUSION:\nWhile participants described commonalities in the barriers and enablers associated with providing MTM to persons with SCI/D and other populations, there were unique considerations identified. These SCI/D-specific considerations resulted in recommendations for improvements in MTM for this population.

To expand access to care for rural-dwelling patients with epilepsy, a national nonprofit organization initiated an integrated, interprofessional telehealth program.\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo identify gaps in care based on a telepharmacist's recommendations and determine whether these recommendations aligned with Health Effectiveness Data Information Set (HEDIS) performance measures.\nMETHODS:\nA retrospective chart review was conducted for patients who had an appointment with an integrated interprofessional care team composed of an epileptologist, a social worker, registered nurses, and a pharmacist. This novel approach integrated provision of care by team members at geographically distinct remote locations. The pharmacist conducted comprehensive medical reviews via video conferencing and made recommendations to the epileptologist, primary care provider, and/or patient, as appropriate. The consultation was documented in the electronic health record (EHR). The pharmacist's recommendations were categorized as 1 of the 24 preselected HEDIS performance measures or as a non-HEDIS measure.

The majority of patients were female (52%), with a mean age of 26.2 years (SD = 14.6, range 4-76) and were taking an average of 6.1 medications (SD = 3.6). 159 comorbidities or conditions were identified in the EHR along with 306 recommendations, for an average of 3.6 recommendations per patient (SD = 3.2). 41 (13.4%) recommendations aligned with preselected HEDIS measures, including medication management for depression (31.7%), hypertension (24.4%), asthma (9.8%), and comprehensive adult diabetes care (14.6%). The remaining 265 recommendations lacked sufficient documentation for categorization or failed to align with any targeted measure.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThis retrospective analysis showed that only 13% of pharmacist recommendations aligned with HEDIS quality measures.

Drug cost sharing can be a barrier to adherence, especially for low-income individuals with chronic conditions. Most of the existing studies in a Medicaid population have evaluated the effects of increasing drug copayments, but few studies have evaluated the effects of reducing drug copayments on medication adherence. Medicaid coverage for low-income childless adults in Wisconsin was expanded on April 1, 2014, which included reductions in drug copayments and monthly caps on out-of-pocket spending.\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo evaluate changes in adherence to oral diabetes medications using proportion of days covered (PDC) among Medicaid childless adults with type 2 diabetes after the 2014 Medicaid drug copayment reduction.\nMETHODS:\nA difference-in-differences design was used to compare the changes in medication adherence between childless adults (treatment group) and parents/caretakers (control group). Wisconsin Medicaid's administrative enrollment records, pharmacy claims, and medical claims data were analyzed. Medication adherence was evaluated for 4 commonly used oral diabetes drug classes (i.e., biguanides, sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones) by adapting the medication adherence quality measures endorsed by the Pharmacy Quality Alliance. The PDC for all diabetes drugs was calculated among patients who filled ≥ 2 prescriptions for any of the 4 drug classes. PDC for each drug class was also measured among patients who had ≥ 2 drug fills for each drug class. The proportion of adherent patients was evaluated using a threshold of PDC ≥ 0.80.\nRESULTS:\nAverage PDC for all diabetes drugs was 0.87 in the childless adults at baseline and significantly increased by 0.02 (P = 0.025) relative to the parents/caretakers after the copayment reduction. The baseline proportion of adherent patients (PDC ≥ 0.80) among the childless adults was 76% and significantly increased by 6.2 percentage points (P = 0.003) relative to the control group. The odds of adherence to oral antidiabetic drugs increased by 47%, resulting in the proportion of adherent patients in the childless adults group reaching almost 80% after the coverage expansion. In the per class analyses, a significant effect was found for biguanides; the proportion of adherent patients increased by 5.5 percentage points in childless adults compared with the control group (P = 0.022).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThis program evaluation found that a reduction of drug copayments in Wisconsin Medicaid improved the quality of medication use by increasing adherence to oral antidiabetic drugs among childless adults.\nDISCLOSURES:\nThis study was conducted as part of a larger study funded by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services.

We used multivariable regression to estimate the association of each measure with county-level demographics and health service measures.\nRESULTS:\nA 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in the proportion of African Americans living in a county is associated with a 0.096 SD decrease in adequacy of supply (βAS = -0.096; 95% CI = -0.14 to -0.06).

Such variation more likely reflects predisposing and enabling factors potentially affected by social, economic, and public health policy.

This necessitates a comprehensive review and assessment of their accuracy in identifying nonadherent patients.\nOBJECTIVES:\nTo (a) compare administrative claims-based measures of adherence with nonadherence verified by patient interview; (b) determine if and to what extent patients classified as nonadherent based on prescription claims differ from patients classified as nonadherent based on interventions designed to gather multiple types of medication lists to compare against the prescription fill history; and (c) assess the various patient-reported reasons for nonadherence.\nMETHODS:\nA cross-sectional study was used to identify patients from the Southern Piedmont Community Care Network of North Carolina who were enrolled with Medicaid between January 1, 2012, and May 31, 2013, and were using prescription medications for 1 or more chronic conditions. Patients with more than a 30-day gap in refill history were identified using prescription claims and were interviewed by pharmacists to assess the reasons for nonadherence. Based on the patient-reported reasons for a gap in refill, patients were classified as interview-verified nonadherent patients or interview-verified adherent patients. The positive predictive value of prescription claims in identifying nonadherent patients was calculated, and descriptive statistics were reported. Characteristics of interview-verified nonadherent patients were compared with adherent patients using t-tests and chi-square statistics.\nRESULTS:\n1,425 patients representing 2,936 patient-class of medication combinations were included in the final analysis. 824 (28.07%) of the 2,936 records that were flagged as nonadherent using claims analysis were confirmed as adherent during patient interviews. The positive predictive value of claims records in identifying nonadherent patients was 0.72. The 2 most common reasons for patients to be misclassified as nonadherent in claims data following self-report were discontinuation of medication on prescribers' directions (21.93%) and having an alternate channel for receiving the medication (6.13%). Among interview-verified nonadherent patients, side effects, patient beliefs, education, and socioeconomic barriers were the most common patient-reported reasons for gaps in refill.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nPrescription claims may underestimate adherence in patients. When interviewed directly by a pharmacist, most patients reported discontinuation of medication as per prescribers' directions. To determine the overall validity of prescription claims data, further analysis is required to assess its accuracy in identifying truly nonadherent patients among those who are identified as nonadherent by claims data.\nDISCLOSURES:\nNo outside funding supported this study.

The survey was hosted on GEDEFO's website during  March and April 2017. Activity data for 2016 was collected. Results: A total of 95 hospitals responded to the survey. Out of which, 76% had an integrated information system of  pharmacotherapeutic process management, where a variability in  technological and organizational processes were found. The  oncohematological pharmacist led the implementation of the principles  of medicine, based on evidence and results obtained in routine clinical  practice. It was shown that 88% of hospitals had standardized  protocols. As for safety practices, in 83% of hospitals,  oncohematological pharmacists actively participated in the development  and maintenance of risk management program, implemented to prevent  errors. Preparation was centralized in 89% of hospitals. Variability was observed in pharmaceutical care depending on  where the patient was attended.

Previous publications investigating the effects of physical activity (PA) on medical costs have made use of small sample sizes. We assessed the relationship between PA and 1-year medical expenditure among Taiwanese patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).Data were recruited from three governmental databases, including the 2012 adult preventive health service database.

Patients were stratified according to age and Charlson score. Multivariate linear regression models were used to determine β-coefficients and their P values.Overall, 218,960 individuals were identified with diabetes. The prevalence of the disease was 13.1% among sufficiently active, 35% among insufficiently active, and 51.9% among physically inactive adults. In general, patients who had exercise >150 minutes/week had lower health care spending (i.e., US$ 755.83) followed by those who had less than 150 minutes/week (US$ 880.08) when compared with inactive patients (P < .0001).

Accelerometer data were based on measurements obtained during a 7-day period at baseline.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:\nThe primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs), mortality rates, and 95% CIs were estimated using cubic splines and quartile classifications adjusting for age; sex; race/ethnicity; education; diet; smoking status; body mass index; self-reported health; mobility limitations; and diagnoses of diabetes, stroke, heart disease, heart failure, cancer, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 4840 participants (mean age, 56.8 years; 2435 [54%] women; 1732 [36%] individuals with obesity) wore accelerometers for a mean of 5.7 days for a mean of 14.4 hours per day.

The BNAT score and its components were compared with ECOG Performance Status scores assigned by oncologists and analyzed for correlation and agreement.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 103 male and female individuals (ages 33-87 years) with various cancer diagnoses participated. The mean (SD) ECOG Performance Status score was 0.95 (0.87), range 0 to 3, and the mean BNAT score was 14.9 (4.3), range 5 to 24. Spearman agreement association of BNAT and ECOG Performance Status scores revealed a significant moderate negative relationship (r = -0.568).\nLIMITATIONS:\nThe BNAT was compared with the ECOG Performance Status, a commonly used but subjective measure. Additionally, a common data set was used for both deriving and evaluating the BNAT performance scale.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThere was a moderate negative linear relationship of BNAT to ECOG Performance Status scores across all participants. Utilization of the BNAT may reflect overall physical performance and provide comprehensive and meaningful detail to influence therapeutic decisions.\n© 2020 American Physical Therapy Association.", "authors": ["Quinn SE", "Crandell CE", "Blake ME", "Bontrager AM", "Dempsey AG", "Lewis DJ", "Hamm JT", "Flynn JM", "Smith GS", "Wingard CJ"], "title": "The Correlative Strength of Objective Physical Assessment Against the ECOG Performance Status Assessment in Individuals Diagnosed With Cancer."}, {"references": null, "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/ptj/pzz177", "publication": "Phys Ther. 2020 Mar 10;100(3):438-446. doi: 10.1093/ptj/pzz177.", "topic": "Exercise for Older Adults", "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nSurvivors of breast cancer commonly report functional limitations, including cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and decreased aerobic capacity.

Self-reported upper extremity function using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire and shoulder range of motion, strength, and muscular endurance were measured. Participants were divided into 3 groups: breast cancer involving the nondominant limb (BC-ND), breast cancer involving the dominant limb (BC-DOM), and CTRL.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 59 women in the CTRL group, 23 women in the BC-ND group, and 28 women in the BC-DOM group completed measures. Mean DASH scores in women with breast cancer were higher than those of women in the CTRL group, regardless of the limb on which cancer occurred (Cohen d = 1.13; 95% CI = 2.20 to 16.21) Range of motion for the BC-ND group was significantly less for flexion (Cohen d = 1.19, 95% CI = -13.08 to -0.11) and external rotation (Cohen d = 1.11, 95% CI = -18.62 to -1.98) compared with the CTRL group. Strength in the BC-ND group was 23% to 25% lower in the CTRL group for external (Cohen's d = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.09 to 0.12) and internal rotation (Cohen d = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.13).

The range of post-surgical treatment times was broad, making it difficult to determine when function returned. Muscular endurance measures demonstrated a ceiling effect and large variance, limiting the ability to distinguish differences among participants. These results may not be generalizable to the subset of women who were treated with lumpectomy, sentinel node biopsy, or chest wall radiation alone or who underwent a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy.\nCONCLUSION:\nIn the long term, women with breast cancer have lower self-reported shoulder function than women without breast cancer.

Since whole body vibration (WBV) is known to efficiently stimulate the neuromuscular system and enhance cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength in frail individuals, we hypothesized that WBV would maintain various physical and psychological capacities in patients during alloHCT. Seventy-one patients were randomly allocated to either an intervention group (IG) doing WBV or an active control group (CG) doing mobilization exercises five times per week. We determined peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) and maximum power, maximum strength, functional performance, body composition, quality of life (QoL), and fatigue. Tests were carried out before conditioning therapy, at hospital discharge and at day ± 180 (follow-up). As 18 patients did not participate in post-intervention assessment and follow-up data from 9 patients was not collectible, per-protocol (PP) analysis of 44 patients is presented. During hospitalization, WBV maintained maximum strength, height, and power output during jumping, as well as reported QoL, physical functioning, and fatigue level compared with mobilization. At follow-up, relative VO2peak (p = 0.035) and maximum power (p = 0.011), time and power performing chair-rising test (p = 0.022; p = 0.009), and reported physical functioning (p = 0.035) significantly increased in the IG, while fatigue decreased (p = 0.005). CG's body cell mass and phase angle had significantly decreased at follow-up (p = 0.002; p = 0.004).

There is an urgent need for interventions. The study aimed to determine the effect of high-intensity resistance training (HI-RT), a time- and cost-efficient training modality, on sarcopenia in osteosarcopenic (OS) older men.\nMETHODS:\nForty-three community-dwelling men aged ≥72 years from Northern Bavaria, Germany, with OS were randomly assigned to either an active HI-RT group (HI-RT) or an inactive control group (CG). Both received dietary protein (up to 1.5 g/kg/day in HI-RT and 1.2 g/kg/day in CG) and Vitamin-D (up to 800 IE/d) supplements. The HI-RT was applied as a consistently supervised single-set training on resistance exercise machines using intensifying strategies, with two training sessions/week, structured into three phases (ranging from 8 to 12 weeks) totaling 28 weeks. The primary study endpoint was the Sarcopenia Z-score; secondary endpoints were changes in the underlying physiological parameters, skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), handgrip-strength and gait velocity.\nRESULTS:\nThe results show a significant effect of the exercise intervention on the sarcopenia Z-score in the HI-RT (p<0.001) and a significant worsening of it in the CG (p=0.012) in the intention-to-treat analysis, as well as a significant intergroup change (p<0.001). Analysis upon the underlying parameters showed a significant increase of skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) in the HI-RT group (p<0.001) and a significant intergroup difference of SMI (p<0.001) and handgrip strength (p<0.001). There were no adverse effects related to dietary supplementation or training.\nCONCLUSION:\nThe results clearly confirm the favorable effects of HI-RT on sarcopenia.

Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured using peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), oxygen uptake at the anaerobic threshold (VO2@AT), and maximal power output from cardiopulmonary exercise testing on a bicycle ergometer. Magnetic resonance imaging brain data were analyzed by voxel-based morphometry using regression models with adjustment for age, sex, education, smoking, body weight, systolic blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin level, and intracranial volume.\nRESULTS:\nVolumetric analyses revealed associations of CRF with gray matter (GM) volume and total brain volume. After multivariable adjustment, a 1-standard deviation increase in VO2peak was related to a 5.31 cm³ (95% CI, 3.27 to 7.35 cm³) higher GM volume. Whole-brain voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed significant positive relations between CRF and local GM volumes. The VO2peak was strongly associated with GM volume of the left middle temporal gyrus (228 voxels), the right hippocampal gyrus (146 voxels), the left orbitofrontal cortex (348 voxels), and the bilateral cingulate cortex (68 and 43 voxels).\nCONCLUSION:\nCardiorespiratory fitness was positively associated with GM volume, total brain volume, and specific GM and white matter clusters in brain areas not primarily involved in movement processing.

Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) enables more precise ocular incisions and lens fragmentation than does phacoemulsification cataract surgery (PCS). We hypothesised that FLACS might improve outcomes in cataract surgery compared with PCS despite having higher costs.\nMETHODS:\nWe did a participant-masked randomised superiority clinical trial comparing FLACS and PCS in two parallel groups (permuted block randomisation stratified on centres via a centralised web-based application, allocation ratio 1:1, block size of 2 or 4 for unilateral cases and 2 or 6 for bilateral cases). Five French University Hospitals enrolled consecutive patients aged 22 years or older who were eligible for unilateral or bilateral cataract surgery. Participants, outcome assessors, and technicians carrying out examinations were masked to the surgical treatment allocation until the last follow-up visit and a sham laser procedure was set up for participants randomly assigned to the PCS arm. The primary clinical endpoint was the success rate of surgery, defined as a composite of four outcomes at a 3-month postoperative visit: absence of severe perioperative complication, a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 0·0 LogMAR (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) or better, an absolute refractive error of 0·75 dioptres or less, and unchanged postoperative corneal astigmatism power (≤0·5 dioptres) and axis (≤20°). The primary economic endpoint was the incremental cost per additional patient who had treatment success at 3 months. Primary outcomes were assessed in all randomly assigned patients who met all eligibility criteria (missing data considered as failure). We used mixed logistic regression models or mixed linear regression models for statistical comparisons, adjusted on centres and whether cataract surgery was bilateral or unilateral.

We identified no significant difference in the success rate of surgery between the FLACS and PCS groups (FLACS: 41·1% [289 eyes]; PCS: 43·6% [299 eyes]); adjusted odds ratio 0·85, 95% CI 0·64-1·12, p=0·250). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €10 703 saved per additional patient who had treatment success with PCS compared with FLACS. We observed no severe adverse events during the femtosecond laser procedure, and most of the complications in the FLACS group related to the primary outcome measures occurred during the phacoemulsification phase or postoperatively.\nINTERPRETATION:\nDespite its advanced technology, femtosecond laser was not superior to phacoemulsification in cataract surgery and, with higher costs, did not provide an additional benefit over phacoemulsification for patients or health-care systems.\nFUNDING:\nFrench Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.\nCopyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Of these four hallmarks of cataract, it is protein-protein cross-linking that has been the most intransigent, and it is only recently, with the advent of proteomic methodology, that mechanisms are being elucidated. A diverse range of cross-linking processes involving several amino acids have been uncovered. Although other hypotheses for the etiology of cataract have been advanced, it is likely that spontaneous decomposition of the structural proteins of the lens, which do not turn over, is responsible for the age-related changes to the properties of the lens and, ultimately, for cataract.

The duration of the project is 3 years. During the first year of the project 17 patients were screened, SML implantation was recommended to 4 of them. They met the indication criteria of SML implantation and SML was implanted into the better seeing eye. The third postoperative day, the tES sessions started and were applied 20 times in the first month after SML implantation. The stimulation was delivered in double blind design (a stimulated and a shame group). Visual exercises and rehabilitation took place during the tES.

In comparative trials studying novel micro-invasive glaucoma surgeries in open angle glaucoma, the control group undergoing cataract extraction alone routinely achieved significant reductions in IOP and medication use postoperatively.

Pressure lowering is more significant in eyes with narrow angles and those with higher baseline IOP levels. In eyes with angle closure, phacoemulsification alone can lower IOP, but when combined with GSL it may be even more effective.

Disagreements about article inclusion were discussed and articles were included based on consensus. Data on study design, population, and findings were extracted from each article. Findings were synthesized qualitatively.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 1451 articles were screened for eligibility, 345 were selected for full-text review, and 26 were included. Study population mean ages ranged from 70.8 to 90.1 years. Three (12%) studies reported influenza estimates, 7 (27%) RSV, and 16 (62%) pneumonia. Eighteen (69%) studies reported incidence estimates, 7 (27%) prevalence estimates, and 1 (4%) both. Seven (27%) studies reported outbreaks. Respiratory infection incidence estimates ranged from 1.1 to 85.2% and prevalence estimates ranging from 1.4 to 55.8%. Influenza incidences ranged from 5.9 to 85.2%. RSV incidence proportions ranged from 1.1 to 13.5%. Pneumonia prevalence proportions ranged from 1.4 to 55.8% while incidence proportions ranged from 4.8 to 41.2%.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThe reported incidence and prevalence estimates of respiratory infections among older LTCF residents varied widely between published studies. The wide range of estimates offers little useful guidance for decision-making to decrease respiratory infection burden. Large, well-designed epidemiologic studies are therefore still necessary to credibly quantify the burden of respiratory infections among older adults in LTCFs, which will ultimately help inform future surveillance and intervention efforts.", "authors": ["Childs A", "Zullo AR", "Joyce NR", "McConeghy KW", "van Aalst R", "Moyo P", "Bosco E", "Mor V", "Gravenstein S"], "title": "The burden of respiratory infections among older adults in long-term care: a systematic review."}, {"references": null, "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6531851/", "publication": "BMJ. 2019 May 23;365:l1800. doi: 10.1136/bmj.l1800.", "topic": "Assisted Living", "abstract": "Abstract\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo determine whether extending initial prednisolone treatment from eight to 16 weeks in children with idiopathic steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome improves the pattern of disease relapse.\nDESIGN:\nDouble blind, parallel group, phase III randomised placebo controlled trial, including a cost effectiveness analysis.\nSETTING:\n125 UK National Health Service district general hospitals and tertiary paediatric nephrology centres.\nPARTICIPANTS:\n237 children aged 1-14 years with a first episode of steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome.\nINTERVENTIONS:\nChildren were randomised to receive an extended 16 week course of prednisolone (total dose 3150 mg/m2) or a standard eight week course of prednisolone (total dose 2240 mg/m2). The drug was supplied as 5 mg tablets alongside matching placebo so that participants in both groups received the same number of tablets at any time point in the study. A minimisation algorithm ensured balanced treatment allocation by ethnicity (South Asian, white, or other) and age (5 years or less, 6 years or more).\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:\nThe primary outcome measure was time to first relapse over a minimum follow-up of 24 months. Secondary outcome measures were relapse rate, incidence of frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome and steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome, use of alternative immunosuppressive treatment, rates of adverse events, behavioural change using the Achenbach child behaviour checklist, quality adjusted life years, and cost effectiveness from a healthcare perspective. Analysis was by intention to treat.\nRESULTS:\nNo significant difference was found in time to first relapse (hazard ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 1.17, log rank P=0.28) or in the incidence of frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome (extended course 60/114 (53%) v standard course 55/109 (50%), P=0.75), steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome (48/114 (42%) v 48/109 (44%), P=0.77), or requirement for alternative immunosuppressive treatment (62/114 (54%) v 61/109 (56%), P=0.81).

Softer landing surfaces, such as those provided by low-stiffness \"compliant\" flooring, may prevent fall-related injuries by decreasing the forces applied to the body during fall impact. Our primary objective was to assess the clinical effectiveness of compliant flooring at preventing serious fall-related injuries among LTC residents.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS:\nThe Flooring for Injury Prevention (FLIP) Study was a 4-year, randomized superiority trial in 150 single-occupancy resident rooms at a single Canadian LTC site. In April 2013, resident rooms were block randomized (1:1) to installation of intervention compliant flooring (2.54 cm SmartCells) or rigid control flooring (2.54 cm plywood) covered with identical hospital-grade vinyl. The primary outcome was serious fall-related injury over 4 years that required an emergency department visit or hospital admission and a treatment procedure or diagnostic evaluation in hospital. Secondary outcomes included minor fall-related injury, any fall-related injury, falls, and fracture. Outcomes were ascertained by blinded assessors between September 1, 2013 and August 31, 2017 and analyzed by intention to treat. Adverse outcomes were not assessed. During follow-up, 184 residents occupied 74 intervention rooms, and 173 residents occupied 76 control rooms. Residents were 64.3% female with mean (SD) baseline age 81.7 (9.5) years (range 51.1 to 104.6 years), body mass index 25.9 (7.7) kg/m2, and follow-up 1.64 (1.39) years. 1,907 falls were reported; 23 intervention residents experienced 38 serious injuries (from 29 falls in 22 rooms), while 23 control residents experienced 47 serious injuries (from 34 falls in 23 rooms). Compliant flooring did not affect odds of ≥1 serious fall-related injury (12.5% intervention versus 13.3% control, odds ratio [OR]: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.52 to 1.84, p = 0.950) or ≥2 serious fall-related injuries (5.4% versus 7.5%, OR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.31 to 1.75, p = 0.500). Compliant flooring did not affect rate of serious fall-related injuries (0.362 versus 0.422 per 1,000 bed nights, rate ratio [RR]: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.45 to 2.39, p = 0.925; 0.038 versus 0.053 per fall, RR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.38 to 1.71, p = 0.560), rate of falls with ≥1 serious fall-related injury (0.276 versus 0.303 per 1,000 bed nights, RR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.52 to 1.79, p = 0.920), or time to first serious fall-related injury (0.237 versus 0.257, hazard ratio [HR]: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.52 to 1.62, p = 0.760). Compliant flooring did not affect any secondary outcome in this study. Study limitations included the following: findings were specific to 2.54 cm SmartCells compliant flooring installed in LTC resident rooms, standard fall and injury prevention interventions were in use throughout the study and may have influenced the observed effect of compliant flooring, and challenges with concussion detection in LTC residents may have prevented estimation of the effect of compliant flooring on fall-related concussions.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nIn contrast to results from previous retrospective and nonrandomized studies, this study found that compliant flooring underneath hospital-grade vinyl was not effective at preventing serious fall-related injuries in LTC.

Although obstructive sleep apnea is increasingly recognized as a common comorbidity of mild cognitive impairment, most apnea research has focused on middle-aged adults with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea. Mild obstructive sleep apnea, defined as 5-14 apneas or hypopneas per hour slept, is common in older adults. Little is known about the effect on cognition of adherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in older adults with mild obstructive sleep apnea and mild cognitive impairment.\nOBJECTIVE:\nThe objective of this study was to explore the effect of CPAP adherence on cognition in older adults with mild obstructive sleep apnea and mild cognitive impairment.\nMETHODS:\nWe conducted a secondary analysis of data from Memories 1, a 1-year quasiexperimental clinical trial on the effect of CPAP adherence in older adults with mild cognitive impairment and obstructive sleep apnea. Those with mild obstructive sleep apnea were divided into two groups based on their CPAP adherence over 1 year: (a) CPAP adherent group (mild cognitive impairment + CPAP) with an average CPAP use of ≥4 hours per night and (b) CPAP nonadherent group (mild cognitive impairment - CPAP) with an average CPAP use of <4 hours per night. Individuals currently using CPAP were not eligible. A CPAP adherence intervention was provided for all participants, and an attention control intervention was provided for participants who chose to discontinue CPAP use during the 1-year follow-up. Descriptive baseline analyses, paired t tests for within-group changes, and general linear and logistic regression models for between-group changes were conducted.\nRESULTS:\nThose in the mild cognitive impairment + CPAP group compared to the mild cognitive impairment - CPAP group demonstrated a significant improvement in psychomotor/cognitive processing speed, measured by the Digit Symbol Coding Test. Eight participants improved on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, whereas six worsened or were unchanged. Twelve participants rated themselves as improved on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change Scale, whereas three reported their status as worsened or unchanged. The mild cognitive impairment + CPAP group had greater than an eightfold increased odds of improving on the Clinical Dementia Rating and greater than a ninefold increased odds of improving on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change Scale, compared to the mild cognitive impairment - CPAP group.\nDISCUSSION:\nCPAP adherence may be a promising intervention for slowing cognitive decline in older adults with mild obstructive sleep apnea and mild cognitive impairment.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and neurocognitive tests were performed before and after the 3-month intervention. A temporal efficiency analysis approach was used to examine the spatiotemporal networks of the brain.\nRESULTS:\nParticipants in the mindfulness group had significantly better temporal global efficiency than controls after 3-months of intervention. Localized changes of temporal nodal properties were present in the right cingulate gyrus, insula, and left superior temporal gyrus. Together, these results suggest greater information transmission efficiency at both the global and local spatiotemporal level. In terms of cognitive function, verbal recognition memory improved in the mindfulness group compared to the controls.\nCONCLUSION:\nElders who practiced mindfulness had better brain network efficiency and neurocognitive function relative to controls in this study, suggesting that mindfulness may be of benefit to aging adults with early cognitive degeneration.\n© 2019 The Authors.

Neurofeedback (NF), which is a training mechanism that employs operant conditioning to regulate brain activity, has been increasingly investigated concerning its beneficial effects for dementia and MCI.\nMETHODS:\nThis study investigated cognitive improvement and hemodynamic changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) following NF training in patients with MCI. Five patients with MCI received NF training for enhanced beta band activity in the dorsolateral PFC-16 sessions for 8 weeks-with each session divided into 9 5-minute trials. The primary outcome measure was a cognitive assessment tool: the Korean version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The secondary outcome measures were the Central Nervous System Vital Signs for neurocognitive testing, hemodynamic changes using functional near-infrared spectroscopy in the PFC during a working-memory task, and Beck Depression Inventory scores.\nRESULTS:\nAfter completing the training, patients' cognitive function significantly improved in domains such as composite memory, cognitive flexibility, complex attention, reaction time, and executive function. Increased electroencephalogram beta power was observed over NF training sessions (Spearman rank correlation test: r = 0.746, P = .001). The threshold value for gaining positive feedback from pre-NF baseline on beta power significantly increased (Spearman rank correlation test: r = 0.805, P = .001). Hemodynamic response in PFC changed after NF training, and individual differences were identified. Specifically, hypoactivation of the hemodynamic response by emotional distraction recovered following NF training.\nCONCLUSION:\nWe suggest that patients' cognitive processing efficiency was improved by the NF training.

Previous clinical trials testing whether cholinesterase inhibitors can slow the rate of progression from MCI to AD dementia have yielded disappointing results. However, recent studies of the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in AD have demonstrated improvements in cognitive function. Because few rTMS trials have been conducted in MCI, we designed a trial to test the short-term efficacy of rTMS in MCI. Yet, in both MCI and AD, we know little about what site of stimulation would be ideal for improving cognitive function. Therefore, two cortical sites will be investigated in this trial: (1) the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which has been well studied for treatment of major depressive disorder; and (2) the lateral parietal cortex (LPC), a novel site with connectivity to AD-relevant limbic regions.\nMETHODS/DESIGN:\nIn this single-site trial, we plan to enroll 99 participants with single or multi-domain amnestic MCI. We will randomize participants to one of three groups: (1) Active DLPFC rTMS; (2) Active LPC rTMS; and (3) Sham rTMS (evenly split between DLPFC and LPC locations). After completing 20 bilateral rTMS treatment sessions, participants will be followed for 6 months to test short-term efficacy and track durability of effects. The primary efficacy measure is the California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II), assessed 1 week after intervention. Secondary analyses will examine effects of rTMS on other cognitive measures, symptoms of depression, and brain function with respect to the site of stimulation. Finally, selected biomarkers will be analyzed to explore predictors of response and mechanisms of action.\nDISCUSSION:\nThe primary aim of this trial is to test the short-term efficacy of rTMS in MCI. Additionally, the project will provide information on the durability of cognitive effects and potentially distinct effects of stimulating DLPFC versus LPC regions. Future efforts would be directed toward better understanding therapeutic mechanisms and optimizing rTMS for treatment of MCI. Ultimately, if rTMS can be utilized to slow the rate of progression to AD dementia, this will be a significant advancement in the field.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION:\nClinical Trials NCT03331796.

Health literacy was measured using the Chinese Citizen Health Literacy Questionnaire.\nRESULTS:\nThe scores of total health literacy and its three dimensions (basic health knowledge and mind, basic skills, and health lifestyle and behavior) were lower in those with mild cognitive impairment. Older adults with normal cognitive function had adequate or marginal health literacy levels, whereas those with mild cognitive impairment had marginal or inadequate health literacy levels. Using multiple logistic regression analysis, we found that health literacy risk, education level, age, marital status, and body mass index were independent risk factors for mild cognitive impairment.\nDISCUSSION:\nThese results suggest that low health literacy may be a predictor of mild cognitive impairment.

We assessed its safety and potential efficacy in a 3-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and medial temporal lobe atrophy.\nMETHODS:\nPatients 55 to 85 years of age with MCI, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 0.5, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score >24, Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Verbal Paired Associates I score ≤18, and Medial Temporal Lobe Atrophy Scale score >1 were stratified by APOE ε4 genotype and randomly assigned (1:1) to ladostigil 10 mg/d or placebo. Primary outcomes were safety and onset of Alzheimer disease dementia. Secondary endpoints were Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) composite, Disability Assessment in Dementia (DAD), and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) scores. Exploratory outcomes were NTB component, CDR, and MMSE scores. Biomarkers included MRI-derived whole-brain, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex volumes.\nRESULTS:\nTwo hundred ten patients from 15 sites in Austria, Germany, and Israel were randomly allocated to placebo (107 patients) or ladostigil (103 patients). After 36 months, 21 of 103 patients on placebo and 14 of 99 patients receiving ladostigil progressed to Alzheimer disease (log-rank test p = 0.162).

Injection therapy with urethral bulking agents or stem cell formulations have been developed as minimally invasive alternatives. Many synthetic and biological bulking agents have been trialled, but several have been discontinued owing to safety concerns. The use of Macroplastique and Contigen has the largest evidence base, but, overall, success rates seem to be similar between the various agents and positive outcomes are poorly sustained for more than 6 months. Furthermore, subjective cure rates, although initially high, also deteriorate over time. The available data consistently demonstrate manifestly poorer outcomes for injection therapies than for surgery. Stem cell treatments are thought to functionally regenerate the urethral sphincter in patients with suspected intrinsic sphincter deficiency. Autologous adipose and muscle-derived stem cells seem to be the intuitive cell source, as they are comparatively abundant, can be harvested and cause minimal donor site morbidity. To date, only a few small clinical studies have been reported and most data are derived from animal models. The success rates of stem cell injection therapies seem to be comparable with those of bulking agents.", "authors": ["Hillary CJ", "Roman S", "MacNeil S", "Aicher WK", "Stenzl A", "Chapple CR"], "title": "Regenerative medicine and injection therapies in stress urinary incontinence."}, {"references": null, "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7003810/", "publication": "Int J Gynaecol Obstet. 2020 Jan;148 Suppl 1:22-26. doi: 10.1002/ijgo.13035.", "topic": "Urinary Incontinence", "abstract": "Abstract\nAlthough approximately 2 million women suffer from an obstetric fistula, the surgical literature is sparse.

Bivariate analysis was used to compare preoperative parameters against adverse events of interest (Length of stay (LOS) >1, readmission, reoperation, other postoperative complications, and death). Variables that were significant or neared significance (P <.1) in the univariate analysis were entered into multivariable logistic regression models. Multivariable models were used to estimate the probability of adverse events.\nRESULTS:\nAbout 2792 patients underwent surgical treatment for stress urinary incontinence in the American College of Surgeons National Surgery Quality Improvement Program database from 2008 to 2016. Increased length of stay was the most common adverse event (12.7%), followed by other postoperative complications (4.9%), readmission (4%), reoperation (2.3%), and death (0.3%). We noted an association between perioperative adverse events and preoperative hypoalbuminemia. Patients with preoperative hypoalbuminemia compared with patients with normal preoperative serum albumin had an increase predicted probability of LOS >1 day (42% vs 10%), readmission (10% vs 4%), reoperation (6% vs 2%), other postoperative complications (18% vs 4%) after adjusting for other factors.\nCONCLUSION:\nSurgical treatment for stress urinary incontinence is well tolerated with acceptable levels of perioperative adverse events.

Latent Dirichlet Allocation topics are represented as a distribution of words, similar to a word cloud, which were manually reviewed to identify themes.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 985 online posts by 762 unique users were extracted from 98 websites. There was significant overlap between the grounded theory and Latent Dirichlet Allocation identified themes.

Patients were randomized 1:1 to routine pessary care (office visits every 12 weeks, \"routine\" arm) or to extended pessary care (office visits every 24 weeks, \"extended\" arm).

Baseline characteristics of the study arms were similar with the exception of pessary type, with ring pessary more common in the routine arm and Gellhorn pessary more common in the extended arm (P=.02). The rate of epithelial abnormalities at the final study visit (48 weeks) was 7.4% in the routine arm and 1.7% in the extended arm (difference, -5.7 percentage points; 95% CI -7.4 to -4), which met the criterion for noninferiority. Rates of all types of epithelial abnormalities did not differ between arms at any time point. Increasing duration of pessary use (P=.003) and history of prior epithelial abnormalities were associated with development of epithelial abnormalities (P=.01).
