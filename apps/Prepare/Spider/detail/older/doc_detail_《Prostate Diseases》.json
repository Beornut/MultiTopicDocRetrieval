We highlight some of the more promising treatments that are furthest along in development.\nRECENT FINDINGS:\nPatients with dry AMD have long been hoping for a highly efficacious treatment that may slow disease progression or even help regain vision. Patients with wet AMD have many effective treatment options but still there are those who have suboptimal responses or are burdened by the high frequency of treatment. We detail exciting new concepts and targets for novel medications. Specifically, for dry AMD we discuss research looking at complement inhibition, neuroprotection, visual cycle modulators, cell-based therapies, and anti-inflammatory agents. For wet AMD we summarize new, potentially more durable anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents, extended release options, and gene therapy.\nSUMMARY:\nThere are promising new strategies for AMD. Many of the potential new treatments are in or have recently completed phase 2 or phase 3 clinical trials with promising results thus far, including some that have received US Food and Drug Administration approval. Additional therapeutic breakthroughs will likely continue to occur thanks to the number of clinical trials that are nearing the finish line.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIntroduction: Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a sight threatening disease and a major cause for blindness for people in working age. The pathogenesis is multifactorial and complex. The pharmacotherapy of DME addresses both the inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by the intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors and inflammatory processes by the intravitreal application of steroids. Several trials have been published reporting on the efficacy and safety of these treatments.Areas covered: This review discusses original research articles including basic science and clinical studies as well as review articles focusing on the role of inflammation and VEGF expression in DME. It discusses newly published clinical trials on intravitreal pharmacotherapy for DME. The literature was searched using Medline/PubMed and was selected given its relevance for the topic to be discussed.Expert opinion: Our knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of diabetic macular edema has significantly increased. Some of these insights have been successfully transferred into current treatment strategies already including VEGF suppression or anti-inflammatory treatments using steroids. The identification of additional pathophysiological aspects and their relevance as potential treatment targets will be a future challenge in the treatment of DME. A better knowledge on the complex pathophysiology will also help to establish combination strategies.",

Although the gold standard for diagnosis involves 3D imaging, 2D imaging by fundus photography is usually used in screening settings, resulting in high false-positive and false-negative calls. To address this, we train a deep learning model to predict ci-DME from fundus photographs, with an ROC-AUC of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.87-0.91), corresponding to 85% sensitivity at 80% specificity. In comparison, retinal specialists have similar sensitivities (82-85%), but only half the specificity (45-50%, p < 0.001). Our model can also detect the presence of intraretinal fluid (AUC: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.81-0.86) and subretinal fluid (AUC 0.88; 95% CI: 0.85-0.91). Using deep learning to make predictions via simple 2D images without sophisticated 3D-imaging equipment and with better than specialist performance, has broad relevance to many other applications in medical imaging.",

The mechanism(s) responsible for massive and progressive retinal degeneration is not completely known. Senescence, a state of permanent inhibition of cell growth, may be induced by many factors important for AMD pathogenesis and results in senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that releases growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, proteases and other molecules inducing inflammation and other AMD-related effects. These effects can be induced in the affected cell and neighboring cells, leading to progression of AMD phenotype. Senescent cells also release reactive oxygen species that increase SASP propagation. Many other pathways of senescence-related AMD pathogenesis, including autophagy, the cGAS-STING signaling, degeneration of CC by membrane attack complex, can be considered. A2E, a fluorophore present in lipofuscin, amyloid-beta peptide and humanin, a mitochondria-derived peptide, may link AMD with senescence. Further studies on senescence in AMD pathogenesis to check the possibility of opening a perspective of the use of drugs killing senescent cells (senolytics) and terminating SASP bystander effects (senostatics) might be beneficial for AMD that at present is an incurable disease.",

Since AMD is a multifactorial age-related disease with various genetic risk factors, the understanding of its complex pathophysiology is still limited. However, animal experiments, genome-wide association data and the molecular profiling of AMD patient samples have highlighted a key role of systemic and local immune processes that contribute to this chronic eye disease. In this overview article, we concentrate on the role of lymphocytes and mononuclear phagocytes and their interplay in triggering a persistent immune response in the AMD retina. We preferentially review findings from human immune cell analyses and complement these with related findings in experimental models. We conclude that both immune cell types as their signaling network may be a rich source to identify novel molecular targets for immunomodulation in AMD.",

We do not know the cause of the disease and have inadequate prevention and treatment strategies for those at risk or affected. The greatest risk factors include age and race, with the white population at the highest risk for the disease. We developed the hypothesis that pigmentation in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) protects darkly pigmented individuals from AMD. We have tested this hypothesis in multiple ways including dissecting the pigmentation pathway in RPE using albinism-related tools, identification of a G protein-coupled receptor in the pigmentation pathway that drives expression of trophic factors, and using a very large retrospective chart analysis to test whether the ligand for the receptor prevents AMD. In total, our results indicate that pigmentation of the RPE is a cornerstone of RPE-retinal interaction and support and that the receptor in the pigmentation pathway most likely underlies the racial bias of the disease. The ligand for that receptor is an ideal candidate as a preventative and treatment for AMD. Here we summarize these results, discussing the research in its entirety with one overall goal, treatment or prevention of AMD.",

The duration of the project is 3 years. During the first year of the project 17 patients were screened, SML implantation was recommended to 4 of them. They met the indication criteria of SML implantation and SML was implanted into the better seeing eye. The third postoperative day, the tES sessions started and were applied 20 times in the first month after SML implantation. The stimulation was delivered in double blind design (a stimulated and a shame group). Visual exercises and rehabilitation took place during the tES. The patients were examined ophthalmologically and also using electrophysiological methods.\nRESULTS:\nBefore the implantation, the best corrected distance visual acuity was 0.23. At near it was Jaeger number 15 uncorrected, with +3.0 sphere dioptres J.No.10.5 and with +6.0 sph dpt J.No. 4.5. After the surgery and visual rehabilitation BCVA was 0.13 after 3 weeks, 0.2 after 2 months and 0.14 after 6 months. At near it was uncorrected J.No.7.5 after 3 weeks, J.No.7 after 2 months and J.No.5 after 6 months.\nCONCLUSION:\nAccording to a few participants, the impact of SML implantation together with intensive visual rehabilitation on vision at near and on satisfaction of patients with AMD could not be significantly established. Nevertherless, these patients are limited in their daily activities and SML is one of the solutions for them. The project is ongoing and blinded still, there is also a need of more participants to assess the effect of tES on vision, the results will be presented. We have proven the safety of methods used in the project.",

Subjects were randomly assigned to receive monthly intravitreal ranibizumab injections either until macular edema resolved or until both macular edema and HEs resolved. All subjects underwent spectral-domain optical coherence tomography imaging (Cirrus OCT), at baseline and monthly for 12 months. Mean HE area and mean macular thickness at baseline and month 12 were compared using a paired t test and correlated with Pearson analysis.\nRESULTS:\nThe average age of the 24 subjects was 65 (±8.55) years. There was a significant decrease (P = .001) in mean HE area from baseline (0.48 ± 0.43 mm2) to month 12 (0.17 ± 0.19 mm2). There was a significant increase (P < .001) in best-corrected visual acuity from a letter score of 63.38 (±7.92) at baseline to 76.38 (±8.93) at month 12. There was no additional vision benefit for continuing to treat with monthly injections for persistent HE in the absence of macular thickening.\nCONCLUSION:\nIn eyes with DME, monthly intravitreal ranibizumab injections resulted in significant reduction in intraretinal HEs that paralleled reductions in macular thickness and volume. Baseline foveal HEs were associated with worse vision outcomes, and continued treatment for persistent HEs in the absence of edema did not result in better vision.\nCopyright © 2019.

The correlation of BCVA and CMT changes at each visit was evaluated in the three study arms individually. Then, the eyes in each of the arms were classified at each follow-up visit into three subgroups based on their CMT changes related to the baseline CMT: CMT decrease of 30% or more of baseline CMT, between 10% to 29% of baseline CMT, and less than 9% of baseline CMT or CMT increase.\nRESULTS:\nBCVA and CMT changes were correlated significantly (P < .05) in all and in half of the follow-up visits, respectively, in the eyes treated by IVZ 1.25 mg and IVB (r = 0.554 and r = 0.617 at 1 year, respectively). Nevertheless, such a significant correlation was not detected in the eyes treated by IVZ 2.5 mg in any of the follow-up visits (r = 0.202 at 1 year; P = .259). In the IVZ 2.5 mg group, BCVA improvement was observed in all subgroups with each level of CMT reductions.\nCONCLUSION:\nZiv-aflibercept 2.5 mg might have a beneficial effect on DME beyond thickness reduction.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a mounting cause of loss of sight in the elderly in the developed countries, a trend enhanced by the continual ageing of the population. AMD is a multifactorial and only partly understood, malady. Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for most AMD patients. It is known that oxidative stress (OS) damages the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and contributes to the progression of AMD. We review here the potential importance of two OS-related cellular systems in relation to AMD. First, the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2; NRF2)-mediated OS response signalling pathway is important in the prevention of oxidative damage and a failure of this system could be critical in the development of AMD. Second, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) represents a change in the cellular phenotype, which ultimately leads to the fibrosis encountered in RPE, a characteristic of AMD. Many of the pathways triggering EMT are promoted by OS. The possible interconnections between these two signalling routes are discussed here. From a broader perspective, the control of NFE2L2 and EMT as ways of preventing OS-derived cellular damage could be potentially valuable in the therapy of AMD.",

Safety data was collected after 30 minutes, 1 and 7 days, and 4, 8 and 12 weeks after injection. Changes in continuous variables were compared using paired t-test and categorical variables were compared using chi-square test of proportions. Repeated-Measures ANOVA with nesting test was used to compare variations in continuous variables by IVZ dose over time. Primary outcome measures were ocular and systemic adverse events at 4 weeks.\nRESULTS:\nEleven females and nine males, with mean age of 63.2± 7.3 years were included. Ocular adverse events included subconjunctival haemorrhage in 1 eye, intraocular pressure (IOP) >21mmHg at 30 minutes in 6 eyes and mild pain in 3 eyes at 1-day. There was no significant difference in IOP rise between the 2 groups at 30 minutes (p = 0.21). No other ocular or systemic adverse events were observed. There was significant improvement in the best corrected visual acuity (LogMAR) from 0.95±0.6 to 0.6±0.4 (p<0.01) and 0.47±0.3 (p<0.01), reduction in central subfield foveal thickness from 405.9±140 um at baseline to 255.6±75 um (p<0.01) and 238±88 um (p<0.01) at 4 and 12 weeks respectively, although no difference was observed between the 2 groups (p = 0.34).\nCONCLUSION:\nIVZ at 1.25mg and 2mg had similar safety profiles, and did not have any major unexpected adverse events.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a medical condition that affects the quality of life by causing lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in 40% to 70% of men aged ≥60 years. Medication treatment is primarily recommended for patients with BPH if their symptom score based on the International Prostate Symptom score (IPSS) is above the moderate level. However, electroacupuncture (EA) and electronic moxibustion (EM), one of the most recent complementary and alternative treatments, are suggested as adjuvant treatments in the improvement of LUTS caused by BPH with respect to the limitations of medication treatments, such as side effects or no improvement in LUTS despite treatment. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of EA and its cotreatment with EM for the improvement of LUTS in patients diagnosed with BPH using an alpha blocker but with moderate symptoms on the basis of IPSS.\nMETHODS/DESIGN:\nThis protocol is a 2-arm parallel-design, randomized, controlled assessor-blinded clinical trial. Seventy-eight patients diagnosed with BPH are randomized to one of the following groups: [EA and its cotreatment with EM + alpha blocker group] and [alpha blocker group]. [EA and its cotreatment with EM + alpha blocker group] continues to use the previously prescribed alpha blocker and visits the study institution 3 times a week for 6 weeks to receive the cotreatment of EA and EM. [Alpha blocker group] continues to use the previously prescribed alpha blocker for 6 weeks. To evaluate the effectiveness of the EA and its cotreatment with EM, the followings are measured: total score of the IPSS, IPSS quality of life assessment, EuroQol-Five dimension, maximum and average urinary flow rate (Qmax and Qave), and prostate size at the baseline, 3rd, 6th, and 12th weeks. The primary effectiveness endpoint measures the average change in the total score of the IPSS at the 6th week. Side effects are recorded at each visit.\nDISCUSSION:\nThe results of this study are expected to provide useful information on the effectiveness and safety of the EA and its cotreatment with EM for patients with BPH with regard to the improvements in LUTS.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION:\nClinical Research Information Service of Republic of Korea (CRIS-KCT0004411), October 31, 2019.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nBenign prostatic enlargement (BPE) causes discomfort in daily life, including lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) caused by the enlarged prostate, and requires long-term management as a chronic, irreversible disease. To improve LUTS, certain complementary therapies have been used with or without doctors' directions. Conventional treatments and complementary therapies tend to be combined unsystematically, depending on patient preference; thus, research for safe and efficient combination therapy is warranted.\nMETHODS:\nTwenty-nine participants were randomly assigned to an integrative group (IG, n = 15) or a conventional group (CG, n = 14). The IG received moxibustion (twice weekly for 4 weeks, at the acupuncture points SP6, LR3, and CV4) and conventional medication for 4 weeks, followed by conventional medication alone for 8 weeks. The CG received conventional medication alone for 12 weeks. The outcome measures were International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), patient's global impression of changes (PGIC), maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax), postvoid residual urine volume (PVR), and frequency-volume chart.\nRESULTS:\nTotal IPSS (IG, -2.4 ± 4.2; CG, 0.9 ± 4.0; P = .039), PGIC-A (IG, 3.5 ± 1.0; CG, 2.2 ± 1.0; P = .001), and PGIC-B (IG, 3.5 ± 0.1; CG, 4.7 ± 0.6; P = .004) were significantly improved in the IG compared with the CG, 4 weeks after baseline. Among the IPSS items, incomplete emptying (IG, -0.6 ± 0.7; CG, 0.4 ± 1.2; P = .019), straining (IG, -0.6 ± 0.8; CG, 0.2 ± 1.2; P = .046), and nocturia (IG, -0.8 ± 1.4; CG, 0.1 ± 1.0; P = .045) showed significant differences. The Qmax and PVR volume did not differ significantly at 12 weeks after the baseline.\nCONCLUSION:\nMoxibustion can be considered an adjunct therapy to improve LUTS in BPE patients. A full-sized randomized controlled trial would be feasible with comparator modifications and an extended study period. The study design should include a placebo group and narrow the eligibility to subjects who do not respond well to conventional treatments.",

Bibliometric analyses are quantitative approaches examining the impact of academic literature. We used the following search terms and Boolean logic \"(\"benign prostat*\") AND (hyperplasia OR enlarg*)\" and characterized the 100 most-cited BPH articles through 2018 including citations, journal, author, year, and country.\nRESULTS:\nThe top 100 BPH articles were published between 1978 and 2012. Citations ranged from 153 to 2171 across 27 different journals, including 10 urology-specific journals. The Journal of Urology was the most published journal (n = 25), followed by European Urology (n = 17), and Urology (n = 15). In general, the oldest 10 articles focused on BPH etiology/pathogenesis, while the newest 10 focused on treatment. The 1990's was the most productive decade with nearly half of the top 100 articles (n = 44). Twenty-six different countries contributed to the top 100 articles, with the US (n = 74), Italy (n = 19), and Canada (n = 12) being the most common.\nCONCLUSION:\nThis study represents the first bibliometric analysis of the leading BPH articles impacting the academic literature. The focus has evolved from BPH pathogenesis to treatment, perhaps reflecting a shift in research funding and capacity. These findings may guide research priorities for this increasingly common condition.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

Ejaculatory hood sparing vaporization was performed with preservation of the paracollicular and supracollicular tissue proximal to the verumontanum in 25 patients. Patients were assessed at baseline, and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively using the Ej-MSHQ (Ejaculatory Domain of Male Sexual Health Questionnaire) and the IIEF-15 (International Index of Erectile Function-15). The I-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Score), uroflowmetry and post-void residual urine volume were reported at each followup visit. A standard urodynamic study was performed at 6 months.\nRESULTS:\nAntegrade ejaculation was reported in 85% and 31.6% of patients after hood sparing and standard prostate vaporization, respectively (p=0.001). A significant reduction in the EJ-MSHQ score was reported after standard vaporization at 6 and 12 months (each p <0.001) with no significant difference after hood sparing vaporization (p=0.18 and 0.078, respectively). The median EJ-MSHQ score was 28.5 (range 1 to 33) and 27 (range 1 to 33) for hood sparing vaporization, and 9.5 (range 1 to 35) and 9 (range 0 to 33) for standard vaporization at 6 (p=0.005) and 12 months (p <0.001), respectively. Each group showed a decline in the mean total IIEF-15 score at 1 year but it was statistically significant only after standard vaporization (p=0.001). All urinary outcome measures revealed comparable significant improvement at all followups. Postoperative urodynamic assessment demonstrated a significant comparable decrease in the Bladder Outlet Obstruction Index from a median of 64 (range 21 to 207) to 23.5 (range 10 to 53) after hood sparing vaporization (p=0.005) and from 87 (range 38 to 186) to 19.5 (range 7 to 51) after standard vaporization (p=0.001). At 1 year the overall re-treatment rate was comparable in the 2 groups (p=0.26).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nIn well informed, sexually interested patients ejaculatory hood sparing GreenLight prostate photoselective vaporization is feasible and effective treatment of small to moderate sized benign prostatic hyperplasia with a superior sexual function related outcome. Short-term relief of obstruction is objectively comparable to that of standard prostate photoselective vaporization.",

The primary outcomes were the maximal flow rate (Qmax) and international prostate symptoms score (IPSS) at 12 months after surgical treatment. Secondary outcomes were Qmax and IPSS values at 6, 24, and 36 months after surgical treatment; perioperative parameters; and surgical complications.\nDATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS:\nTwo independent reviewers extracted the study data and performed quality assessments using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. The effect sizes were summarised using weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes and odds ratios for binary outcomes. Frequentist approach to the network meta-analysis was used to estimate comparative effects and safety. Ranking probabilities of each treatment were also calculated.\nRESULTS:\n109 trials with a total of 13 676 participants were identified. Nine surgical treatments were evaluated. Enucleation achieved better Qmax and IPSS values than resection and vapourisation methods at six and 12 months after surgical treatment, and the difference maintained up to 24 and 36 months after surgical treatment. For Qmax at 12 months after surgical treatment, the best three methods compared with monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) were bipolar enucleation (mean difference 2.42 mL/s (95% confidence interval 1.11 to 3.73)), diode laser enucleation (1.86 (-0.17 to 3.88)), and holmium laser enucleation (1.07 (0.07 to 2.08)). The worst performing method was diode laser vapourisation (-1.90 (-5.07 to 1.27)). The results of IPSS at 12 months after treatment were similar to Qmax at 12 months after treatment. The best three methods, versus monopolar TURP, were diode laser enucleation (mean difference -1.00 (-2.41 to 0.40)), bipolar enucleation (0.87 (-1.80 to 0.07)), and holmium laser enucleation (-0.84 (-1.51 to 0.58)). The worst performing method was diode laser vapourisation (1.30 (-1.16 to 3.76)). Eight new methods were better at controlling bleeding than monopolar TURP, resulting in a shorter catheterisation duration, reduced postoperative haemoglobin declination, fewer clot retention events, and lower blood transfusion rate. However, short term transient urinary incontinence might still be a concern for enucleation methods, compared with resection methods (odds ratio 1.92, 1.39 to 2.65). No substantial inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence was detected in primary or secondary outcomes.\nCONCLUSION:\nEight new endoscopic surgical methods for benign prostatic hyperplasia appeared to be superior in safety compared with monopolar TURP. Among these new treatments, enucleation methods showed better Qmax and IPSS values than vapourisation and resection methods.\nSTUDY REGISTRATION:\nCRD42018099583.\nPublished by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nLower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH) are one of the most common conditions seen in middle-aged and elderly men and threaten their quality of life. Since conventional pharmacotherapy for LUTS/BPH can lead to sexual side effects, herbal therapies are widely used as complementary and alternative treatments worldwide. HT080 is an herbal extract of Cinnamomum cassia and Rosa Laevigata, both of which have been used to treat symptoms typically associated with BPH in traditional Asian medicine. The aims of this trial are to assess whether HT080 can alleviate LUTS/BPH in middle-aged and elderly men, and to investigate the safety of HT080.\nMETHODS/DESIGN:\nA double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-arm parallel group trial will be conducted in men with moderate LUTS/BPH. A total of 100 eligible men aged 40 to 75 years with an International Prostate Symptom Score of 8 to 19 will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio and receive either HT080 (500 mg) or placebo twice a day for 12 weeks. All participants will be evaluated for efficacy and safety at baseline and weeks 6 and 12. The primary endpoint is the change in International Prostate Symptom Score between baseline and week 12. The secondary efficacy variables are uroflowmetry parameters (maximal urinary flow rate and post-void residual volume), serum prostate-specific antigen, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone levels, the International Index of Erectile Function score, and participant-reported global response assessment scores. The safety assessments include adverse events, laboratory tests results, vital signs, and physical examination.\nDISCUSSION:\nThis is a first-in human trial designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of HT080 among middle-aged and elderly men with LUTS/BPH. This prospective study with a double-blind randomized design will provide high-quality evidence supporting the use of HT080 for LUTS/BPH.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION:\nKorean Clinical Research Information Service (KCT0004286) Registered September 6, 2019.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn recent years, the progress of science and medicine greatly has influenced human life span and health. However, lifestyle habits, like physical activity, smoking cessation, moderate alcohol consumption, diet, and maintaining a normal body weight represent measures that greatly reduce the risk of various diseases. The type of diet is very important for disease development. Numerous epidemiological clinical data confirm that longevity is linked to predominantly plant-based diets and it is related to a long life; whereas the western diet, rich in red meat and fats, increases the risk of oxidative stress and thus the risk of developing various diseases and pre-aging. This review is focused on the bioavailability of polyphenols and the use of polyphenols for the prevention of prostate diseases. Special focus in this paper is placed on the isoflavonoids and flavan-3-ols, subgroups of polyphenols, and their protective effects against the development of prostate diseases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nHolmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) is considered the standard endoscopic treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), but traditional HoLEP surgery will cause some postoperative complications. This study was attempted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of modified two-lobe technique versus traditional three-lobe technique of HoLEP focusing mainly on incidences of retrograde ejaculation (RE) and urinary incontinence (UI).\nMETHODS:\nFrom March 2014 to February 2017, 191 men with BPH were randomly assigned to two groups: 97 underwent modified two-lobe technique; 94 underwent traditional three-lobe technique. All patients were followed up for 12 months. Primary outcomes were incidences of RE and UI, and secondary outcomes were international prostate symptom score (IPSS), quality of life (QOL), maximal urine flowing rate (MFR), and residual urine among the studied patients.\nRESULTS:\nCompared with the traditional technique, patients in the modified group had a statistically significant decrease in frequency of UI (1.03% vs 8.51%, p=0.036) and RE in the 6th month (33.33% vs 63.64%, p=0.030) and 12th month (13.33% vs 50%, p=0.034) and a significant increase in ejaculatory volume in the 6th month (p=0.050) and 12th month (p=0.003). Besides, the modified HoLEP was more beneficial to patients according to the change of QoL score at 1 month (p=0.002), 3 months (p=0.004), 6 months (p=0.026), and 12 months (p=0.015).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThe modified two-lobe technology of HoLEP reduced the incidence of RE and UI, which improved the quality of life of the patients after surgery compared to the traditional three-lobe technology. This trial is registered with ChiCTR1800018553.\nCopyright © 2019 Congcong Xu et al.",
