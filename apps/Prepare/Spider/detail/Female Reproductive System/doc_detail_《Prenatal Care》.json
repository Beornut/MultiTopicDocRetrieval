This study tested if feeding and agonistic behaviors before calving were associated with the development of hyperketonemia (HYK) and metritis after calving. Holstein cows on 5 commercial farms were monitored for HYK (as identified using a cow-side β-hydroxybutyrate test) and metritis (using visual and olfactory assessment of vaginal discharge); both tests were conducted twice a week for 2 wk. Based on this assessment, we selected a balanced sample of cows that remained healthy (no signs of illness; n = 20), cows diagnosed with either HYK (n = 20) or metritis (n = 20), and cows with both HYK and metritis (n = 20). Video recordings from the 8 wk before calving (scored every 2 wk for 90 min immediately after fresh feed delivery) were used to evaluate feeding behavior and competition at the feed bunk. Feeding behavior before calving was associated with postpartum diagnosis of HYK and metritis. Specifically, cows that spent less time eating had higher odds of HYK and metritis. Odds of remaining healthy (compared with becoming sick with at least 1 condition) increased by 1.3 times for every additional 15 min spent eating. Additionally, cows that were involved in fewer agonistic interactions prepartum were more likely to be diagnosed with both conditions during the postpartum period. Odds of remaining healthy (compared with becoming sick with at least one condition) increased by 1.9 times for every 6 additional interactions. We conclude that prepartum feeding and agonistic behaviors can be used to identify animals at risk of HYK and metritis postpartum.\nCopyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

Although numerous studies have been performed to find the therapeutic agents for endometritis, the incidence of this disease remains high. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the major metabolic products of anaerobic bacteria fermentation in the gut, have been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effects and mechanisms of sodium butyrate (SB) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endometritis in mice. The mice were administered by intraperitoneal injection of SB at 1 h before LPS injection. 24 h later, the uterus tissues were collected. Hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) stained sections of uterus were used to determine the degree of the damage. Uterine myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was used to analyze neutrophil granulocytes concentration. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were measured by ELISA. The activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. The results showed that SB significantly attenuated the pathological injury of the uterus tissues. SB also suppressed LPS-induced MPO activity and the production of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β. Furthermore, Western blot analysis showed that SB inhibited the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway. In addition, SB could inhibit histone deacetylases. In summary, SB protects against LPS-induced endometritis through HDAC inhibition.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Rev-erbα, an important gene in the transcription-translation loop of circadian rhythm, is involved in regulating the balance between pro-inflammation and anti-inflammation. The disruption of this balance in human endometrial stroma cells (hESCs) destroys their biological behavior function in maintaining the menstrual cycle and embryonic implantation. Whether pharmacological modulation of Rev-erbα affects the inflammation of hESCs remains unclear. In this study, we treated hESCs with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and found that LPS treatment increased the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, and TNFα, and the secretion of IL-6. SR9009, a Rev-erbα agonist, significantly alleviated the LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in hESCs. Meanwhile, knockdown of Rev-erbα increased the expressions of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8, accompanied by an increased mRNA level of the core clock gene Bmal1. Western blot analysis showed that SR9009 inhibited the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the activation of NF-κB induced by LPS. All these findings suggested that pharmacological activation of Rev-erbα attenuated the LPS-induced inflammatory response of hESCs by suppressing TLR4-regulated NF-κB activation. This study may provide a strategy for preventing inflammation-related endometrial dysfunction and infertility or recurrent implantation failure.\n© The Author(s) 2019.

The incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) has increased due to the sexually active status of the young population. This leads to a more serious problem and a larger effect than previously observed. However, there have been few studies on this topic in Asian populations.\nAIM:\nWe aimed to evaluate the risk of preterm labor and/or ectopic pregnancy in Taiwanese women following PID.\nDESIGN:\nUsing the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database, we designed a retrospective cohort study that included 12- to 55-year-old pregnant women between 2000 and 2010. We selected a 1:3 age-matched control group of non-PID women. The endpoint was any episode of preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy; otherwise, the patients were tracked until 31 December 2010.\nMETHODS:\nThe risk factors for preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy were explored. For cases included from the index date until the end of 2010, we analyzed the risk of incident preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy. With the use of a multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, we calculated the hazard ratio (HR) with a 95% CI and compared it with that of the control group.\nRESULTS:\nThis study examined 30,450 patients with PID and 91,350 controls. During the follow-up period, patients in the PID group were more likely to develop preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy than patients in the control group. The cumulative incidence rates for developing preterm labor were 1.84% (561/30,450 individuals) in patients with PID and 1.63% (1492/91,350 individuals) in patients without PID. On the other hand, the cumulative incidence rate for developing ectopic pregnancy in patients with PID was 0.05% (14/30,450 individuals) but was only 0.04% (33/91,350 individuals) in patients without PID.

Although the incidence of postpartum endometritis is merely 1-5% after vaginal births, it remains the most common source of puerperal sepsis, contributing up to 15% of maternal mortality in low income countries. Geographically-remote centres in Malaysia prophylactically administer antibiotics for women with ragged placental membranes after vaginal birth, extrapolating evidence from retained placenta. We sought to clarify the rationale in continuing such practices.\nMETHODS:\nThis was an open-label, prospective, multicentre, randomized trial. Three hospitals where the current protocol was to administer prophylactic amoxycillin-clavulanic acid served as the sites of recruitment. Women who delivered vaginally beyond 24+ 0 weeks of gestation with ragged membranes were invited to participate in the trial and randomized into prophylaxis or expectant management with medical advice by blocks of 10, at a 1:1 ratio. A medication adherence diary was provided and patients followed up at 2 weeks and 6 weeks postpartum.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 6569 women gave birth vaginally in three centres during the trial period, of which 10.9% had ragged membranes. The incidence of endometritis was not significantly raised in women with or without prophylaxis (0.90% vs 0.29%; p = 0.60). All cases of endometritis presented within the first 2 weeks and preventive use of antibiotics did not ameliorate the severity of endometritis since rates of ICU admission, surgical evacuation and transfusion were comparable.\nCONCLUSION:\nPreventive use of antibiotics after vaginal delivery in women with ragged placental membranes did not result in a reduction of endometritis. Educating women on the signs and symptoms of endometritis would suffice. Based on the reported incidence of ragged membranes, a change in practice would result in 1500 less prescriptions of antibiotics per annum in these three centres.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION:\nNCT03459599 (Retrospectively registered on 9 March 2018).", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6624936/"}, {"references": null, "authors": ["Fouks Y", "Azem F", "Many A", "Cohen Y", "Levin I", "Cohen A"], "topic": "Pelvic Inflammatory Disease", "title": "Fertility outcomes in patients with tubo-ovarian abscesses after an oocyte retrieval: a longitudinal cohort analysis.", "publication": "Arch Gynecol Obstet. 2019 Sep;300(3):763-769. doi: 10.1007/s00404-019-05230-9.

Milk progesterone analysis was used to monitor reproductive cyclicity in 170 dairy cows across three different commercial herds.

The sequelae of chlamydia disproportionately impact women in terms of severity and cost. Untreated chlamydia progresses to pelvic inflammatory disease in 40% of cases, and is a leading cause of fallopian tube damage and pelvic adhesive disease resulting in ectopic pregnancy, tubal infertility, and acute and chronic pelvic pain. Tubal infertility is among the leading indications for in vitro fertilization (IVF) nationally and rates among couples undergoing IVF at military treatment centers are double the national average.

The most significant cause of post-partum infection is caesarean section; 20-25% of operations are followed by wound infections, endometritis or urinary tract infections. Approximately 13% of women in the UK undergo operative vaginal delivery (OVD) with forceps or vacuum, which is also associated with an increased risk of infection, estimated at 0.7%-16% of these deliveries. Despite this, previous reviews have identified only one small trial of antibiotic prophylaxis in 393 women and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the routine use of prophylactic antibiotics after OVD. The ANODE trial, a multicentre, blinded, placebo-controlled trial from the UK, is due to report findings from more than 3400 women in 2019 and will be the largest study to date of antibiotic prophylaxis following OVD.\nCopyright © 2018.

A standardized evaluation of the dermoscopic images was performed and the results were statistically analyzed.\nRESULTS:\nSixty-five lesions were included in the study, 22 (33.8%) of them MPD and 43 (66.2%) controls. The most frequent dermoscopic criteria of MPD were white scales (86.4%) and pink structureless areas (81.8%), followed by dotted vessels (72.7%), erosion/ulceration (68.2%) and white shiny lines (63.6%). The multivariate analysis showed that white scales and pink structureless areas were significant predictors of MPD, posing a 68-fold and a 31-fold probability of MPD, respectively. Split of the population into pigmented and non-pigmented lesions showed that in pigmented MPD, pink structureless areas, white lines and grey granules and dots are positive predictors of the disease. Among non-pigmented lesions, pink structureless areas, white lines, erosion/ulceration and white scales served as predictors of MPD.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThe most frequent profile of an individual with MPD is an elderly female with unilateral, asymptomatic, erythematous plaque of the nipple, dermoscopically displaying pink structureless areas, fine white scales, dotted and a few short linear vessels.

Patients who present with bloody nipple discharge with or without the presence of Paget's disease constitute one-third of all symptomatic in situ patients. Only rarely does an invasive cancer cause nipple discharge in the absence of a clinical mass. Even more obscure is the case of the invasive cancer involving solely the nipple-areolar complex. Sir James Paget first described 'an eczematous change in the skin of the nipple preceding an underlying mammary cancer' in 1874, which is now known as Paget's disease, considered to be ductal carcinoma in situ of the nipple-areolar region. There are two competing theories as to the pathogenesis of Paget's disease of the breast-one suggests that Pagetoid cells are keratinocytes that have undergone malignant transformation. According to this theory, Paget's disease of the breast represents an in situ carcinoma of the skin-and that overlying skin changes and underlying malignancy are discontinuous. The second theory suggests that cells migrate along basement membranes and enter the epidermis and dermis of the nipple-areola complex.

While melanoma (MM) of the NAC is exceedingly rare, benign lesions are more frequent but could be difficult to distinguish from MM. Besides MM, other malignant tumours can affect this area and in particular Paget's disease (PD). For clinically doubtful lesions, biopsy is required, with possible functional and aesthetic consequences in this sensitive area. Dermoscopy and reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) are widely used techniques for the diagnosis of many skin lesions, but their use for NAC lesions is not well established. The objective of this study was to evaluate current literature on these imaging techniques for NAC lesions. We searched in Medline, PubMed and Cochrane database all studies up to November 2018 dealing with dermoscopy, RCM and this special site. We found that the most described malignant tumour was PD and that only two primary MMs of the NAC have been reported with these imaging techniques. Although there are few data on diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive imaging techniques for NAC lesions, it seems that dermoscopy and RCM can add relevant information to be integrated with clinical examination for the diagnosis of NAC lesions and in particular for the differential diagnosis of PD and eczema.\n© 2019 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/jdv.15727"}, {"references": null, "authors": ["Arafah M", "Arain SA", "Raddaoui EMS", "Tulba A", "Alkhawaja FH", "Al Shedoukhy A"], "topic": "Breast Cancer", "title": "Molecular subtyping of mammary Paget's disease using immunohistochemistry.", "publication": "Saudi Med J. 2019 May;40(5):440-446. doi: 10.15537/smj.2019.5.23967.", "abstract": "Abstract\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo evaluate the molecular subtypes of Mammary Paget's disease (MPD) and the associated breast carcinomas.\nMETHODS:\nThis retrospective study was carried out at King Khalid University Hospital and King Faisal Specialist Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

A chi-square test was used to identify differences in categorical data among different groups. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, Cox proportional hazards models, sequential landmark analysis, and propensity score-matched analysis.\nRESULTS:\nThe study cohort included 5398 patients. Triple-negative BC accounted for the fewest patients with PD-only (1/22, 4.54%), Paget's disease-ductal carcinoma in situ (PD-DCIS) (3/48, 6.25%), and Paget's disease-invading ductal carcinoma (PD-IDC) (23/352, 6.53%).

At present, there is lack of clarity on PD's pathogenesis, the relationship between its subtypes, and its lineage link with the underlying invasive carcinomas. Here we describe that mammary PD and EMPD have similar mutational profiles, with the most frequent recurrent mutations occurring in the chromatin remodeling genes, such as KMT2C (MLL3, 39%) and ARID2 (22%), with additional recurrent somatic mutations detected in genes previously not known to be mutated in cancers, such as CDCC168 (34%), FSIP2 (29%), CASP8AP2 (29%), and BIRC6 (24%). In paired mammary PD and underlying breast carcinoma samples, distinct gene mutations were detected, indicating that they represent independent oncogenic events. Finally, multistage EMPD tissue sequencing revealed KMT2C gene occurring early in EMPD oncogenesis, and that multifocal EMPD samples share the same early gene mutations, suggesting clonal origin of multifocal EMPD. Our results reveal similar genomic landscapes between mammary PD and EMPD, including early aberrations in chromatin remodeling genes. In addition, mammary PD and underlying breast ductal carcinomas represent independent oncogenic events.

It is often overlooked and misdiagnosed as benign chronic eczema of the nipple. We aimed to retrospectively verify whether blood flow analysis using Doppler sonography was useful for detecting the presence of Paget disease.\nMETHODS:\nIn this retrospective study, 12 patients with pathologically proven unilateral nipple eczematous lesions (seven with Paget disease and five with simple dermatitis) were included. Nipple blood flow signal was observed using Doppler sonography, and the detected blood flow signals were quantified using digitally recorded images. Quantified blood flow ratio and pathologically examined capillary density were evaluated between affected and unaffected nipples. Findings of mammography, grayscale sonography, and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) were reviewed.\nRESULTS:\nIn patients with Paget disease, Doppler effects in the affected nipple were more clearly visible than those in the unaffected nipple. These effects were sufficiently visible to identify Paget disease. No obvious effects were observed in the affected and unaffected nipples of simple dermatitis. The quantified blood flow ratio and pathologically examined capillary density were significantly higher for the Paget lesion than those for the non-Paget lesion. The sensitivity of CE-MRI and Doppler sonography was markedly correlated, revealing blood flow changes in the nipple lesions of Paget disease.\nCONCLUSION:\nDoppler sonography visualized the proliferation of blood vessels in Paget lesions.

These identified patients included patients with PD (n = 469), patients with PD-IDC (n = 1832), and patients with PD-DCIS (n = 1130) and infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) (n = 498,076). Then, we compared the clinical characteristics of these patients with those who were diagnosed with IDC during the same period. The outcomes of these subtypes of breast carcinoma were different. Based on the overall survival, the patients with PD-IDC had the worst prognosis (5-year survival rate = 84.1%). The PD-DCIS had the best prognosis (5-year survival rate = 97.5%). Besides, among patients with Paget disease, the one who was married had a better prognosis than who were not. And, according to our research, the marital status was associated with the hormone receptor status in patients with PD-IDC. Among three subtypes of Paget disease, patients with PD-IDC had the worst prognosis. Besides, patients who were unmarried had worse outcomes. And the marital status of patients with PD-IDC is associated with hormone status. The observation underscores the importance of individualized treatment.\n© 2018 The Authors.

There are two anatomic subtypes: mammary (MPD) and extramammary (EMPD). Little is known about their molecular characteristics. Our objective was to discover novel molecular markers for PD and its subtypes. In the discovery phase, we used transcriptome analyses to uncover the most differentially expressed genes and pathways in EMPD biopsies compared with normal skin. In the validation phase, we performed immunohistochemistry analyses on the most promising marker (FOXA1) and other markers selected from a literature review (GATA3, estrogen receptor [ER], and androgen receptor [AR]) on independent biopsies of MPD (n = 86), EMPD (n = 59), and normal skin (n = 21). Transcriptome analyses revealed 210 genes differentially expressed more than 10-fold between EMPD and normal skin. These genes are involved in mammary and sweat gland development (FOXA1) and immune regulation, as well as epidermal differentiation. Immunohistochemistry staining revealed that FOXA1 was positive in 88% of both MPD and EMPD, whereas GATA3 was positive in 67% of MPD and 77% of EMPD, and ER was positive in 9% of MPD and 19% of EMPD. Finally, AR was positive in 33% of PD and 54% of EMPD. Mammary Paget's disease and EMPD share dysregulation of the glandular developmental regulator gene FOXA1, suggesting similarity in cell-specific transcriptional regulation. Further, FOXA1 may be a useful molecular target for developing PD therapies.\nCopyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, both cases were without Pagetoid extension or lymph node metastasis. The presently reported tumor consisted of irregularly shaped solid cell nests with delicate fibrovascular cores. The tumor cells had round nuclei with low-grade atypia and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Neuroendocrine differentiation was confirmed by immunohistochemical positivity for CD56, synaptophysin, and chromogranin A. Immunohistochemistry also confirmed the absence of myoepithelial cells around the tumor cell nests. Therefore, a diagnosis of invasive SPC was made. Additionally, tumor cell deposits in the intramammary and axillary lymph nodes were identified, and these deposits had the same histological characteristics as the invasive SPC of the nipple. The invasiveness of SPC can be difficult to determine. However, the tumor cell nests in the current case exhibited a retraction artifact, which is known to be associated with invasive carcinoma and a poor prognosis, as well as morphological patterns that have been previously identified as characteristic of invasive SPC.

We studied 51 cases of condyloma acuminatum of the urinary bladder from transurethral resections of the urinary bladder of 38 patients from the consult files of one of the authors. Transurethral resections of the urinary bladder were obtained from 25 males with a median age of 73 years (range: 41 to 87 y) and 13 females with a median age of 68 years (range: 30 to 86 y). The follow-up period ranged from 15 months to 20 years (median: 6 y). Bladder lesions were accompanied by urethral lesions in 4 men. Eight patients (8/38; 21.0%) had a history of immunosuppression. Seven patients (7/8; 87.5%) from this group had multiple and/or recurrent condylomas. One patient (1/38; 2.6%) with renal transplantation had 10 separate bladder condylomas over time. One patient (1/38; 2.6%) had extensive anogenital condylomas and anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3. One patient (1/8; 12.5%) with renal transplantation presented with a solitary condyloma with synchronous squamous cell carcinoma in situ. Three female patients (3/38; 7.9%) had a history of premalignant vagina/cervix lesions. In total, 17 patients (17/38; 44.7%) had squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder, either invasive or in situ. In all cases, the squamous cell carcinoma (either in situ or invasive) was diagnosed either concurrent with the diagnosis of bladder condyloma or within 1 year of the condyloma diagnosis). In total, 9 of 38 (23.7%) patients had invasive squamous cell carcinoma with or without in situ squamous cell carcinoma. Eight of 38 (21.0%) patients had squamous cell carcinoma in situ only (without a definitive invasive component-in 3 cases invasive squamous cell carcinoma could not be excluded with certainty). In total, 19 patients (19/38; 50%) were positive for either low-risk human papillomavirus (LR-HPV) or high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) or both (3 were positive for both LR-HPV and HR-HPV, 12 patients for only LR-HPV, and 4 for only HR-HPV). Of the 19 patients that were negative for both LR-HPV and HR-HPV, 9 of 19 (47.4%) patients had associated squamous cell carcinoma. Of the 12 patients with only LR-HPV, 4 (33.3%) had associated squamous cell carcinoma (either invasive or in situ). Of the 7 patients with HR-HPV (with or without LR-HPV), 4 (57.1%) has associated squamous cell carcinoma. In summary, condyloma acuminatum of the urinary bladder shows a strong association with squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder, regardless of the condyloma's HPV in situ hybridization results. Immunosuppression is associated with condylomas of the bladder. It is important to distinguish bladder condylomas from papillary urothelial carcinoma, given their different risks for panurothelial disease and risk of squamous cell carcinoma. Recognition of bladder condylomas histologically is often challenging given their rarity, and that they can be negative for both LR-HPV and HR-HPV. The lack of a history of other anogenital human papillomavirus-related lesions further increases the difficulty in establishing the correct diagnosis.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1097/PAS.0000000000001339"}, {"references": null, "authors": ["Yin G", "Li X", "Wang X", "Zhang H"], "topic": "Genital Warts", "title": "Effect of 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy on the expression of apoptosis inhibitors Bcl-2 and Survivin in keratinocytes of condyloma acuminatum.", "publication": "Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther. 2019 Dec;28:53-57. doi: 10.1016/j.pdpdt.2019.07.018.

There was a positive correlation between the expression of Bcl-2 and Survivin in condyloma acuminatum tissues after 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (r = 0.480, P <  0.05).\nCONCLUSION:\n5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy may promote apoptosis of condyloma acuminatum cells by reducing the expression of Bcl-2 and Survivin, suggesting that this is potentially one of the molecular mechanisms of 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy in the treatment of condyloma acuminatum.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of the analysis was evaluating what impact PDT treatment had on their pregnancies and delivery.\nMETHODS:\n10 patients (22-32 years of age, 25.5 years of age on average) were treated with PDT in 2007-2014. 2 patients suffered from squamous cell hyperplasia, 2 patients from vulvar lichen sclerosus, 1 - genital warts, 1 - VIN I (current terminology: LSIL/Flat condyloma), 2 - CIN III (HSIL), 2 - CIN I (LSIL). The patients underwent photodynamic therapy (PDT). In the course of PDT the 5% 5- aminolevulinic acid was used in gel form three hours before irradiation. The affected areas were irradiated with a halogen lamp PhotoDyn 501 (590-760 nm) during a 10-min radiation treatment. The treatment was repeated weekly for 10 weeks.\nRESULTS:\nThe median observation time period between the end of therapy and delivery was 3.92 years (2-7 years). None of the patients suffered from infertility. All patients gave birth to healthy, full-term infants. In case of one pregnancy cervical cerclage was needed. Two patients were treated for hypothyroidism caused by the Hashimoto disease. One patient had gestational diabetes. Two patients had already given birth to 2 children. Five patients gave birth by caesarean section.\nCONCLUSION:\nTopical PDT selectively used for treating the diseases of the female reproductive organs was applied in our group of patients and proved to be a safe method. It had no apparent negative impact on female fertility and allowed these women to give birth to healthy children.\nCopyright © 2019.

Epub 2019 Jun 26.", "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nMore than 10 years have elapsed since human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination was implemented. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of the population-level impact of vaccinating girls and women against human papillomavirus on HPV infections, anogenital wart diagnoses, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+ (CIN2+) to summarise the most recent evidence about the effectiveness of HPV vaccines in real-world settings and to quantify the impact of multiple age-cohort vaccination.\nMETHODS:\nIn this updated systematic review and meta-analysis, we used the same search strategy as in our previous paper. We searched MEDLINE and Embase for studies published between Feb 1, 2014, and Oct 11, 2018. Studies were eligible if they compared the frequency (prevalence or incidence) of at least one HPV-related endpoint (genital HPV infections, anogenital wart diagnoses, or histologically confirmed CIN2+) between pre-vaccination and post-vaccination periods among the general population and if they used the same population sources and recruitment methods before and after vaccination. Our primary assessment was the relative risk (RR) comparing the frequency (prevalence or incidence) of HPV-related endpoints between the pre-vaccination and post-vaccination periods. We stratified all analyses by sex, age, and years since introduction of HPV vaccination. We used random-effects models to estimate pooled relative risks.\nFINDINGS:\nWe identified 1702 potentially eligible articles for this systematic review and meta-analysis, and included 65 articles in 14 high-income countries: 23 for HPV infection, 29 for anogenital warts, and 13 for CIN2+. After 5-8 years of vaccination, the prevalence of HPV 16 and 18 decreased significantly by 83% (RR 0·17, 95% CI 0·11-0·25) among girls aged 13-19 years, and decreased significantly by 66% (RR 0·34, 95% CI 0·23-0·49) among women aged 20-24 years. The prevalence of HPV 31, 33, and 45 decreased significantly by 54% (RR 0·46, 95% CI 0·33-0·66) among girls aged 13-19 years. Anogenital wart diagnoses decreased significantly by 67% (RR 0·33, 95% CI 0·24-0·46) among girls aged 15-19 years, decreased significantly by 54% (RR 0·46, 95% CI 0.36-0.60) among women aged 20-24 years, and decreased significantly by 31% (RR 0·69, 95% CI 0·53-0·89) among women aged 25-29 years. Among boys aged 15-19 years anogenital wart diagnoses decreased significantly by 48% (RR 0·52, 95% CI 0·37-0·75) and among men aged 20-24 years they decreased significantly by 32% (RR 0·68, 95% CI 0·47-0·98). After 5-9 years of vaccination, CIN2+ decreased significantly by 51% (RR 0·49, 95% CI 0·42-0·58) among screened girls aged 15-19 years and decreased significantly by 31% (RR 0·69, 95% CI 0·57-0·84) among women aged 20-24 years.\nINTERPRETATION:\nThis updated systematic review and meta-analysis includes data from 60 million individuals and up to 8 years of post-vaccination follow-up. Our results show compelling evidence of the substantial impact of HPV vaccination programmes on HPV infections and CIN2+ among girls and women, and on anogenital warts diagnoses among girls, women, boys, and men.

Autophagy plays an important role in maintaining internal environmental stability. However, the role of autophagy regulation in the anogenital warts caused by HPV infection remains unknown.\nOBJECTIVE:\nA multigroup case-control study was designed to identify the autophagy gene fingerprint involved in anogenital warts arising from infections with different HPV genotypes.\nMETHODS:\nHuman autophagy PCR arrays were performed on the initial 18 participants grouped by their different HPV genotypes for gene expression-profiling analysis. The negative control was skin samples collected during plastic surgery on the chest from a group of individuals who showed none of the clinical symptoms or evidence of HPV infection. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to validate the microarray results in another 24 individuals.\nRESULTS:\nOut of 84 genes involved in autophagy, different autophagic responses were found among the 29 genes that encode autophagy machinery components, and expression levels of 13 of these genes were downregulated. Finally, we verified that the expression levels of 2 key genes that participate in the formation of autophagosomes, ATG3 and -BECLIN1, were downregulated in the HPV infection groups independently of genotype compared with the control group.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThese findings showed that HPV infection downregulated the expression of ATGs in CA. Additionally, there were no differences in the expression of ATGs between the different HPV genotype infection groups.

Medical therapy for AV in preadolescents has not been well studied. We explore the efficacy and safety profile of sinecatechins 15% ointment and imiquimod 5% cream in the treatment of AV, alone and in combination therapy with other commonly used medications.\nMETHODS:\nA single-institution, retrospective review of children under 12 years of age with AV treated with imiquimod 5% cream and sinecatechins 15% ointment was performed. Demographic data, side effects, and outcomes of therapy were recorded for each patient, and overall efficacy was determined.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 37 patients met inclusion criteria. Responses were seen in 8 out of 9 patients treated with sinecatechins 15% ointment (5 full, 3 partial, and 1 no response) and 9 out of 17 patients treated with imiquimod 5% cream (4 full, 5 partial, and 8 no response). Combination therapy with one or more of the following treatments (podophyllin, cimetidine, candida antigen injection, and HPV vaccine) were evaluated, but no combination was objectively superior to the others. No significant difference was found in overall efficacy between sinecatechins and imiquimod. Side effects were mild and limited to irritation and erythema.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nBoth imiquimod 5% cream and sinecatechins 15% ointment are moderately effective in the treatment of AV in preadolescent children, with a trend toward greater effectiveness of sinecatechins. Combination therapy with other treatments did not significantly increase the effectiveness of topical therapies. Each modality has a tolerable side effect profile with a low risk of serious complications.\n© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/pde.13881"}, {"references": null, "authors": ["Zeng J", "Qu P", "Hu Y", "Sun P", "Qi J", "Zhao G", "Gao Y"], "topic": "Cervical Cancer", "title": "Clinicopathological risk factors in the light of the revised 2018 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging system for early cervical cancer with staging IB: A single center retrospective study.", "publication": "Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Apr;99(16):e19714. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000019714.", "abstract": "Abstract\nTo validate the revised 2018 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system for cervical cancer on the survival of patients who underwent radical hysterectomy for 2009 FIGO stage IB carcinomas.We retrospectively identified and reviewed 251 patients treated with radical hysterectomy for 2009 FIGO stage IB cervical carcinomas from January 2011 to December 2016.

Colposcopy-directed tumor biopsies were confirmed by histology and used for genomic DNA extraction. The Roche Linear Array HPV genotyping test was used for HPV genotyping. Peripheral whole blood was used for HIV-1 rapid testing. Fully automated FC500MPL/CellMek with PanLeucogate (PLG) was used to determine absolute CD4 count, CD4 percentage, and CD45 count. Chi-squared test, a logistic regression model, parametric Pearson correlation, and ROC curves were used for statistical analyses. We used the Benjamini-Horchberg test to control for false discovery rate (FDR, q-value). All tests were significant when both P and q were <.05.Age was a significant predictor for invasive cervical cancer (ICC) in both HIV-1-seronegative (P < .0001, q < 0.0001) and HIV-1-positive women (P = .0003, q = 0.0003). Sixty eight percent (59/87) of HIV-1-positive women with different stages of cervical disease presented with a CD4 percentage equal or less than 28%, and a median absolute CD4 count of 400 cells/μl (IQR 300-500 cells/μl). Of the HIV-1-positive women, 75% (30/40) with ICC, possessed ≤28% CD4 cells vs 25% (10/40) who possessed >28% CD4 cells (both P < .001, q < 0.001).

In turn, development of ICC in HIV-1-positive women is independent of the host CD4 cells and associates with low CD4 percentage regardless of absolute CD4 count that falls within the normal range. Thus, using CD4 percentage may add a better prognostic indicator of cervical disease stage than absolute CD4 count alone.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000019273"}, {"references": null, "authors": ["Lupi LA", "Cucielo MS", "Silveira HS", "Gaiotte LB", "Cesário RC", "Seiva FRF", "de Almeida Chuffa LG"], "topic": "Cervical Cancer", "title": "The role of Toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathway in ovarian, cervical, and endometrial cancers.", "publication": "Life Sci. 2020 Apr 15;247:117435. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117435.

Among all subtypes, the TLR4 is a highly described transmembrane protein involved in the inflammatory process. The TLR4/myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) signaling pathway has been implicated in oncogenic events in several tissues and is associated with survival of patients. Through activation, TLR4 recruits adaptor proteins, i.e., MyD88 or TRIF, to triggers canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways that result in distinct immune responses. In most cancer cells, uncontrolled TLR4 signaling modifies the tumor microenvironment to proliferate and evade immune surveillance. By contrast, TLR4 activation can produce antitumor activities, thereby inhibiting tumor growth and enhancing the proper immune response. We review herein recent approaches on the role of the TLR4 signaling pathway and discuss potential candidates for gynecological cancer therapies; among these agents, natural and synthetic compounds have been tested both in vitro and in vivo. Since TLR4 ligands have been investigated as effective immune-adjuvants in the context of these aggressive malignancies, we described how TLR4 signaling controls part of the tumor-related inflammatory process and which are the new targeting molecules implicated in the regulation of tumorigenicity in ovarian, cervical, and endometrial cancers.\nCopyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Patients receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy routinely experience several side effects including toxicity, non-targeted damage of tissues, hair loss, neurotoxicity, multidrug resistance (MDR), nausea, anemia and neutropenia. Phytochemicals can interfere with almost every stage of carcinogenesis to prevent cancer development. Many natural compounds are known to activate/deactivate multiple redox-sensitive transcription factors that modulate tumor signaling pathways. Polyphenols have been found to be promising agents against cervical cancer. However, applications of phytochemicals as a therapeutic drug are limited due to low oral bioavailability, poor aqueous solubility and requirement of high doses. Nano-sized phytochemicals (NPCs) are promising anti-cancer agents as they are required in minute quantities which lowers overall treatment costs. Several phytochemicals, including quercetin, lycopene, leutin, curcumin, green tea polyphenols and others have been packaged as nanoparticles and proven to be useful in nano-chemoprevention and nano-chemotherapy. Nanoparticles have high biocompatibility, biodegradability and stability in biological environment. Nano-scale drug delivery systems are excellent source for enhanced drug specificity, improved absorption rates, reduced drug degradation and systemic toxicity.

Epub 2020 Jan 30.", "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nWHO is developing a global strategy towards eliminating cervical cancer as a public health problem, which proposes an elimination threshold of four cases per 100 000 women and includes 2030 triple-intervention coverage targets for scale-up of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination to 90%, twice-lifetime cervical screening to 70%, and treatment of pre-invasive lesions and invasive cancer to 90%. We assessed the impact of achieving the 90-70-90 triple-intervention targets on cervical cancer mortality and deaths averted over the next century. We also assessed the potential for the elimination initiative to support target 3.4 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)-a one-third reduction in premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by 2030.\nMETHODS:\nThe WHO Cervical Cancer Elimination Modelling Consortium (CCEMC) involves three independent, dynamic models of HPV infection, cervical carcinogenesis, screening, and precancer and invasive cancer treatment. Reductions in age-standardised rates of cervical cancer mortality in 78 low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) were estimated for three core scenarios: girls-only vaccination at age 9 years with catch-up for girls aged 10-14 years; girls-only vaccination plus once-lifetime screening and cancer treatment scale-up; and girls-only vaccination plus twice-lifetime screening and cancer treatment scale-up. Vaccination was assumed to provide 100% lifetime protection against infections with HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, and to scale up to 90% coverage in 2020. Cervical screening involved HPV testing at age 35 years, or at ages 35 years and 45 years, with scale-up to 45% coverage by 2023, 70% by 2030, and 90% by 2045, and we assumed that 50% of women with invasive cervical cancer would receive appropriate surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy by 2023, which would increase to 90% by 2030. We summarised results using the median (range) of model predictions.\nFINDINGS:\nIn 2020, the estimated cervical cancer mortality rate across all 78 LMICs was 13·2 (range 12·9-14·1) per 100 000 women. Compared to the status quo, by 2030, vaccination alone would have minimal impact on cervical cancer mortality, leading to a 0·1% (0·1-0·5) reduction, but additionally scaling up twice-lifetime screening and cancer treatment would reduce mortality by 34·2% (23·3-37·8), averting 300 000 (300 000-400 000) deaths by 2030 (with similar results for once-lifetime screening). By 2070, scaling up vaccination alone would reduce mortality by 61·7% (61·4-66·1), averting 4·8 million (4·1-4·8) deaths. By 2070, additionally scaling up screening and cancer treatment would reduce mortality by 88·9% (84·0-89·3), averting 13·3 million (13·1-13·6) deaths (with once-lifetime screening), or by 92·3% (88·4-93·0), averting 14·6 million (14·1-14·6) deaths (with twice-lifetime screening). By 2120, vaccination alone would reduce mortality by 89·5% (86·6-89·9), averting 45·8 million (44·7-46·4) deaths. By 2120, additionally scaling up screening and cancer treatment would reduce mortality by 97·9% (95·0-98·0), averting 60·8 million (60·2-61·2) deaths (with once-lifetime screening), or by 98·6% (96·5-98·6), averting 62·6 million (62·1-62·8) deaths (with twice-lifetime screening). With the WHO triple-intervention strategy, over the next 10 years, about half (48% [45-55]) of deaths averted would be in sub-Saharan Africa and almost a third (32% [29-34]) would be in South Asia; over the next 100 years, almost 90% of deaths averted would be in these regions. For premature deaths (age 30-69 years), the WHO triple-intervention strategy would result in rate reductions of 33·9% (24·4-37·9) by 2030, 96·2% (94·3-96·8) by 2070, and 98·6% (96·9-98·8) by 2120.\nINTERPRETATION:\nThese findings emphasise the importance of acting immediately on three fronts to scale up vaccination, screening, and treatment for pre-invasive and invasive cervical cancer. In the next 10 years, a one-third reduction in the rate of premature mortality from cervical cancer in LMICs is possible, contributing to the realisation of the 2030 UN SDGs. Over the next century, successful implementation of the WHO elimination strategy would reduce cervical cancer mortality by almost 99% and save more than 62 million women's lives.\nFUNDING:\nWHO, UNDP, UN Population Fund, UNICEF-WHO-World Bank Special Program of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction, Germany Federal Ministry of Health, National Health and Medical Research Council Australia, Centre for Research Excellence in Cervical Cancer Control, Canadian Institute of Health Research, Compute Canada, and Fonds de recherche du Québec-Santé.\nCopyright © 2020 The Author(s).

Epub 2020 Jan 30.", "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nThe WHO Director-General has issued a call for action to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem. To help inform global efforts, we modelled potential human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and cervical screening scenarios in low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) to examine the feasibility and timing of elimination at different thresholds, and to estimate the number of cervical cancer cases averted on the path to elimination.\nMETHODS:\nThe WHO Cervical Cancer Elimination Modelling Consortium (CCEMC), which consists of three independent transmission-dynamic models identified by WHO according to predefined criteria, projected reductions in cervical cancer incidence over time in 78 LMICs for three standardised base-case scenarios: girls-only vaccination; girls-only vaccination and once-lifetime screening; and girls-only vaccination and twice-lifetime screening. Girls were vaccinated at age 9 years (with a catch-up to age 14 years), assuming 90% coverage and 100% lifetime protection against HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. Cervical screening involved HPV testing once or twice per lifetime at ages 35 years and 45 years, with uptake increasing from 45% (2023) to 90% (2045 onwards). The elimination thresholds examined were an average age-standardised cervical cancer incidence of four or fewer cases per 100 000 women-years and ten or fewer cases per 100 000 women-years, and an 85% or greater reduction in incidence. Sensitivity analyses were done, varying vaccination and screening strategies and assumptions. We summarised results using the median (range) of model predictions.\nFINDINGS:\nGirls-only HPV vaccination was predicted to reduce the median age-standardised cervical cancer incidence in LMICs from 19·8 (range 19·4-19·8) to 2·1 (2·0-2·6) cases per 100 000 women-years over the next century (89·4% [86·2-90·1] reduction), and to avert 61·0 million (60·5-63·0) cases during this period. Adding twice-lifetime screening reduced the incidence to 0·7 (0·6-1·6) cases per 100 000 women-years (96·7% [91·3-96·7] reduction) and averted an extra 12·1 million (9·5-13·7) cases. Girls-only vaccination was predicted to result in elimination in 60% (58-65) of LMICs based on the threshold of four or fewer cases per 100 000 women-years, in 99% (89-100) of LMICs based on the threshold of ten or fewer cases per 100 000 women-years, and in 87% (37-99) of LMICs based on the 85% or greater reduction threshold. When adding twice-lifetime screening, 100% (71-100) of LMICs reached elimination for all three thresholds. In regions in which all countries can achieve cervical cancer elimination with girls-only vaccination, elimination could occur between 2059 and 2102, depending on the threshold and region. Introducing twice-lifetime screening accelerated elimination by 11-31 years. Long-term vaccine protection was required for elimination.\nINTERPRETATION:\nPredictions were consistent across our three models and suggest that high HPV vaccination coverage of girls can lead to cervical cancer elimination in most LMICs by the end of the century. Screening with high uptake will expedite reductions and will be necessary to eliminate cervical cancer in countries with the highest burden.\nFUNDING:\nWHO, UNDP, UN Population Fund, UNICEF-WHO-World Bank Special Program of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction, Canadian Institute of Health Research, Fonds de recherche du Québec-Santé, Compute Canada, National Health and Medical Research Council Australia Centre for Research Excellence in Cervical Cancer Control.\nCopyright © 2020 The Author(s).

There is an authentic dilemma between patient's frailty, residual life expectancy and the toll that take anticancer treatments. Since elder patients are almost always excluded from clinical trials, it is hard to get robust scientific data on the tolerability of oncologic treatments and to set in place recommendations. Cervix cancer is traditionally diagnosed in younger women but it has a 2nd incidence peak between 60 and 70 years old. Cervix cancer in elder patients is a subject to many questions in terms of screening and is a therapeutic challenge. This article reviews literature data on these different aspects, from screening to surgery, from radiotherapy to brachytherapy, from chemotherapy to supportive care, from immunotherapy to geriatric assessment. We tried to show how modern therapeutic innovations may benefit elder patients. Expected benefits in terms of efficacy and toxicity may overcome the long-lasting tendency to undertreatment in elder patients and improve their quality of life after cancer treatment. In 2020, there seems to be less and less reasons justifying that elder women with cervix cancer may not receive the appropriate treatment.\nCopyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In this chapter, a completely integrated CAD system based on deep learning is presented to diagnose breast lesions from digital X-ray mammograms involving detection, segmentation, and classification. To automatically detect breast lesions from mammograms, a regional deep learning approach called You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) is used. To segment breast lesions, full resolution convolutional network (FrCN), a novel segmentation model of deep network, is implemented and used. Finally, three conventional deep learning models including regular feedforward CNN, ResNet-50, and InceptionResNet-V2 are separately adopted and used to classify or recognize the detected and segmented breast lesion as either benign or malignant. To evaluate the integrated CAD system for detection, segmentation, and classification, the publicly available and annotated INbreast database is used over fivefold cross-validation tests. The evaluation results of the YOLO-based detection achieved detection accuracy of 97.27%, Matthews's correlation coefficient (MCC) of 93.93%, and F1-score of 98.02%. Moreover, the results of the breast lesion segmentation via FrCN achieved an overall accuracy of 92.97%, MCC of 85.93%, Dice (F1-score) of 92.69%, and Jaccard similarity coefficient of 86.37%. The detected and segmented breast lesions are classified via CNN, ResNet-50, and InceptionResNet-V2 achieving an average overall accuracies of 88.74%, 92.56%, and 95.32%, respectively.

Data are needed on the use of supplemental magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to improve early detection and reduce interval breast cancers in such patients.\nMETHODS:\nIn this multicenter, randomized, controlled trial in the Netherlands, we assigned 40,373 women between the ages of 50 and 75 years with extremely dense breast tissue and normal results on screening mammography to a group that was invited to undergo supplemental MRI or to a group that received mammography screening only. The groups were assigned in a 1:4 ratio, with 8061 in the MRI-invitation group and 32,312 in the mammography-only group. The primary outcome was the between-group difference in the incidence of interval cancers during a 2-year screening period.\nRESULTS:\nThe interval-cancer rate was 2.5 per 1000 screenings in the MRI-invitation group and 5.0 per 1000 screenings in the mammography-only group, for a difference of 2.5 per 1000 screenings (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0 to 3.7; P<0.001). Of the women who were invited to undergo MRI, 59% accepted the invitation. Of the 20 interval cancers that were diagnosed in the MRI-invitation group, 4 were diagnosed in the women who actually underwent MRI (0.8 per 1000 screenings) and 16 in those who did not accept the invitation (4.9 per 1000 screenings). The MRI cancer-detection rate among the women who actually underwent MRI screening was 16.5 per 1000 screenings (95% CI, 13.3 to 20.5). The positive predictive value was 17.4% (95% CI, 14.2 to 21.2) for recall for additional testing and 26.3% (95% CI, 21.7 to 31.6) for biopsy. The false positive rate was 79.8 per 1000 screenings. Among the women who underwent MRI, 0.1% had either an adverse event or a serious adverse event during or immediately after the screening.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThe use of supplemental MRI screening in women with extremely dense breast tissue and normal results on mammography resulted in the diagnosis of significantly fewer interval cancers than mammography alone during a 2-year screening period.

Purpose To calculate the pooled upgrade rate of percutaneously diagnosed pure ADH. Materials and Methods A search of MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was performed in October 2018. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, or PRISMA, guidelines were followed. A fixed- or random-effects model was used, along with subgroup and meta-regression analyses. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used for study quality, and the Egger test was used for publication bias. Results Of 521 articles, 93 were analyzed, providing data for 6458 ADHs (5911 were managed with surgical excision and 547 with follow-up). Twenty-four studies used core-needle biopsy; 44, vacuum-assisted biopsy; 21, both core-needle and vacuum-assisted biopsy; and four, unspecified techniques. Biopsy was performed with stereotactic guidance in 29 studies; with US guidance in nine, with MRI guidance in nine, and with mixed guidance in eight. Overall heterogeneity was high (I2 = 80%). Subgroup analysis according to management yielded a pooled upgrade rate of 29% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 26%, 32%) for surgically excised lesions and 5% (95% CI: 4%, 8%) for lesions managed with follow-up (P < .001). Heterogeneity was entirely associated with surgically excised lesions (I2 = 78%) rather than those managed with follow-up (I2 = 0%). Most variability was explained by guidance and needle caliper (P = .15). At subgroup analysis of surgically excised lesions, the pooled upgrade rate was 42% (95% CI: 31%, 53%) for US guidance, 23% (95% CI: 19%, 27%) for stereotactic biopsy, and 32% (95% CI: 22%, 43%) for MRI guidance, with heterogeneity (52%, 63%, and 56%, respectively) still showing the effect of needle caliper. When the authors considered patients with apparent complete lesion removal after biopsy (subgroups in 14 studies), the pooled upgrade rate was 14% (95% CI: 8%, 23%). Study quality was low to medium; the risk of publication bias was low (P = .10). Conclusion Because of a pooled upgrade rate higher than 2% (independent of biopsy technique, needle size, imaging guidance, and apparent complete lesion removal), atypical ductal hyperplasia diagnosed with percutaneous needle biopsy should be managed with surgical excision.\n© RSNA, 2019 See also the editorial by Brem in this issue.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2019190748"}, {"references": null, "authors": ["Taylor-Phillips S", "Stinton C"], "topic": "Mammography", "title": "Double reading in breast cancer screening: considerations for policy-making.", "publication": "Br J Radiol. 2020 Feb 1;93(1106):20190610. doi: 10.1259/bjr.20190610.

The purpose of this study was to compare the cancer detection rates (CDRs), tumor types, and characteristics between screening digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and screening full-field digital mammography (FFDM) in a matched patient population in a large academic breast imaging practice with mixed DBT and FFDM technology. MATERIALS AND METHODS. In this retrospective study, we reviewed consecutive screening FFDM and DBT examinations performed between October 2012 and September 2014. To control for nonrandomized selection of FFDM versus DBT examinations, we applied propensity score matching on the basis of patient age, imaging site, and prior imaging findings. An institutional breast cancer registry identified cancer diagnoses. CDR and tumor type, grade, receptor, nodal status, and size were compared between matched FFDM and DBT groups. RESULTS. Sixty-one cancers were detected in the matched screening cohort of DBT (n = 9817) and FFDM (n = 14,180) examinations. CDR was higher with DBT than with FFDM for invasive cancers (2.8 vs 1.3, p = 0.01), minimal cancers (2.4 vs 1.2, p = 0.03), estrogen receptor-positive invasive cancers (2.6 vs 1.1, p = 0.01), and node-negative invasive cancers (2.3 vs 1.1, p = 0.02.), respectively. The ratio of screen-detected invasive cancers to ductal carcinoma in situ on DBT (3.0) was not significantly different from that on FFDM (2.6) (p = 0.79). CONCLUSION.

Because of the advances in machine learning, especially with use of deep (multilayered) convolutional neural networks, artificial intelligence has undergone a transformation that has improved the quality of the predictions of the models. Recently, such deep learning algorithms have been applied to mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). In this review, the authors explain how deep learning works in the context of mammography and DBT and define the important technical challenges. Subsequently, they discuss the current status and future perspectives of artificial intelligence-based clinical applications for mammography, DBT, and radiomics. Available algorithms are advanced and approach the performance of radiologists-especially for cancer detection and risk prediction at mammography. However, clinical validation is largely lacking, and it is not clear how the power of deep learning should be used to optimize practice. Further development of deep learning models is necessary for DBT, and this requires collection of larger databases. It is expected that deep learning will eventually have an important role in DBT, including the generation of synthetic images.\n© RSNA, 2019.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6822772/"}, {"references": null, "authors": ["Gao Y", "Goldberg JE", "Young TK", "Babb JS", "Moy L", "Heller SL"], "topic": "Mammography", "title": "Breast Cancer Screening in High-Risk Men: A 12-year Longitudinal Observational Study of Male Breast Imaging Utilization and Outcomes.", "publication": "Radiology. 2019 Nov;293(2):282-291. doi: 10.1148/radiol.2019190971.

There may be a potential role in selective screening in men at elevated risk for breast cancer, but the effectiveness of such screening remains unexplored. Purpose To evaluate patterns of male breast imaging utilization, to determine high-risk screening outcomes, and to delineate risk factors associated with cancer diagnosis. Materials and Methods This retrospective study reviewed consecutive male breast imaging examinations over a 12-year period (between 2005-2017). Examination indications, biopsy recommendations, and pathologic results were correlated with patient characteristics. Fisher exact test, Mann-Whitney test, Spearman correlation, and logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. Results A total of 1869 men (median age, 55 years; range, 18-96 years) underwent 2052 examinations yielding 2304 breast lesions and resulting in 149 (6.5%) biopsies in 133 men; 41 (27.5%) were malignant and 108 (72.5%) were benign. There were 1781 (86.8%) diagnostic and 271 (13.2%) screening examinations. All men undergoing screening had personal or family history of breast cancer and/or genetic mutations. There was a significant increase in the number of examinations in men relative to the number of examinations in women over time (Spearman correlation, r = 0.85; P < .001). Five node-negative cancers resulted from screening mammography, yielding a cancer detection rate of 18 per 1000 examinations (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7, 41), with cancers diagnosed on average after 4 person-years of screening (range, 1-10 person-years). Mammographic screening sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of biopsy were 100% (95% CI: 50%, 100%), 95.0% (95% CI: 93.1%, 98%), and 50% (95% CI: 22.2%, 77.8%). Older age (P < .001), Ashkenazi descent (P < .001), genetic mutations (P = .006), personal history (P < .001), and first-degree family history (P = .03) were associated with breast cancer. Non-first-degree family history was not associated with cancer (P = .09). Conclusion There is potential benefit in screening men at high risk for developing breast cancer.

Seven databases were systematically searched and forward and backward searching conducted.

Research indicates that when provided to girls in resource poor settings, cash transfers can increase education and postpone marriage and pregnancy. However, a few studies indicate that they can also have negative effects which can affect their acceptability, such as generating intra-community tensions.Objective: Conceptually informed by Rogers' diffusion of innovation theory, this paper explores factors affecting the acceptability of economic support in a randomized controlled trial in rural Monze and Pemba Districts of Southern Province in Zambia.Methods: Qualitative data were collected through five focus group discussions and six in-depth, semi-structured interviews and analysed using thematic analysis. This study was done in the combined arm of a trial where girls received both economic support and participated in youth clubs offering sexuality and life-skills education.Results: In the study communities, acceptability was encouraging by the belief that economic support provided benefits beyond beneficiaries and that it improved access to education, and reduced teen pregnancies, marriages and school drop-out. However, provision of economic support only to selected girls and their parents and fear among some that the support was linked to satanic practices negatively affected acceptability. These fears were mitigated through community sensitisations.Conclusion: The study demonstrated that relative advantage, observability, simplicity and compatibility were key factors in influencing acceptability of the economic support. However, to enhance acceptability of cash transfer schemes aimed at addressing early marriage and pregnancy, it is important to explore socio-cultural factors that create suspicions and negative perceptions and to provide schemes that are perceived as relatively better than available similar schemes, understood, compatible and viable beyond the immediate beneficiary.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6882474/"}, {"references": null, "authors": ["Mutea L", "Ontiri S", "Macharia S", "Tzobotaro M", "Ajema C", "Odiara V", "Kadiri F", "Orero S", "Kabue M", "Michielsen K", "Gichangi P"], "topic": "Teenage Pregnancy", "title": "Evaluating the effectiveness of a combined approach to improve utilization of adolescent sexual reproductive health services in Kenya: a quasi-experimental design study protocol.", "publication": "Reprod Health. 2019 Oct 29;16(1):153. doi: 10.1186/s12978-019-0825-3.", "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nAccess to and utilization of adolescent sexual and reproductive health (ASRH) services remains poor. ASRH services in Kenya are primarily offered in health facilities and include counselling, information, and services on family planning, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV and basic life skills. The Ministry of Education also provides age-appropriate sexual and reproductive health information in schools. This paper presents a study protocol that will evaluate the effectiveness of a combined approach toward improving utilization of ASRH services.\nMETHODS:\nThis will be a quasi-experimental study utilizing qualitative and quantitative methods. During the formative phase, data will be collected through focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, and key informant interviews to explore the barriers and facilitators of provision and utilization of ASRH services. A quantitative design will be used to obtain baseline and endline data through household surveys and client exit interviews. Following the formative and baseline household and client exit assessments, an intervention focusing on provision of ASRH service package targeting boys and girls will be implemented for 18 months. The package will include contextualized ASRH services, including counselling and age-appropriate, comprehensive sexual education for behavior change with an aim to increase utilization of ASRH services. An analysis of the primary outcome (utilization of ASRH services) will be undertaken to establish the difference in difference between the control and intervention arm, before the intervention (using the baseline survey data) and after the intervention (using the endline survey data).\nDISCUSSION:\nAdolescents have now been included in the World Health Organization's Global strategy for women's, children's and adolescents' health (2016-2030), acknowledging the unique health challenges facing young people and their pivotal role as drivers of change in the post-2015 era. This study will generate evidence on whether a combined school, facility, and community approach works toward improving utilization of ASRH services. The information generated from the study will be beneficial for programming as it will identify underlying reasons for low utilization of ASRH services.

While pregnancy during adolescence poses higher risks for the mother and the baby, the utilisation of maternity care to mitigate the effects is low. This review aimed to synthesise evidence on adolescent mothers' utilisation of maternity care in Sub-Saharan Africa and identify the key determinant factors that influence adolescent mothers' engagement with maternity care.\nMETHOD:\nA systematic review of scholarly literature involving seven databases: ProQuest, PubMed, EMBASE/Elsevier, SCOPUS, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Infomit was conducted. Studies published in English between 1990 and 2017 that examined Sub-Saharan adolescent mothers' experiences of utilising biomedical maternity care during pregnancy, delivery and the post-partum period were included.\nRESULTS:\nFrom 296 relevant articles 27 were identified that represent the experience of adolescent mothers' maternal health service utilisation in Sub-Saharan Africa. The review indicates that maternal health service utilisation in the majority of Sub-Saharan African countries is still low. There is also a wide discrepancy in the use of maternity care services by adolescent mothers across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThe review reveals that a significant number of adolescents in Sub-Saharan Africa do not access and use maternity services during pregnancy. Several factors from individual to systemic levels contributed to low access and utilisation.

Systematic random sampling technique was employed to select 404 students from the total of 3960 female preparatory school students in the study area. Data was collected through self-administered questionnaires. Descriptive summary, binary and multivariate analyses were underwent to identify factors associated with induced abortion.

However, in many low- and middle-income countries, the timing of school dropout and first birth coincide, resulting in a rapid transition from the role of student to the role of mother for adolescent girls. Despite growing interest in the effects of pregnancy on levels of school dropout, researchers have largely overlooked the potential effect of adolescent childbearing on literacy and numeracy. We hypothesize that becoming a mother soon after leaving school may cause the deterioration of skills gained in school. Using longitudinal data from Bangladesh, Malawi, and Zambia, we test our hypothesis by estimating fixed-effects linear regression models to address the endogeneity in the relationship between childbearing and academic skills. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the effects of adolescent childbearing on academic skills in low- and middle-income countries. Our results indicate that among those with low levels of grade attainment, first birth has a negative effect on English literacy and numeracy. Among those with higher levels of grade attainment, we find little evidence of effects of childbearing on academic skills. Childbearing also has little effect on local language literacy. Beyond the immediate loss of English literacy and numeracy, if these skills lead to better health and more economic productivity, then adolescent childbearing may have longer-term repercussions than previously understood. In addition to ongoing efforts to increase educational attainment and school quality in low- and middle-income countries, investments are needed to strengthen the academic skills of adolescent mothers to secure the demographic and economic promise of expanded education for girls and women.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6797635/"}, {"references": null, "authors": ["Murillo-Zamora E", "Mendoza-Cano O", "Guzmán-Esquivel J", "Trujillo-Hernández B", "Higareda-Almaraz MA", "Ahumada-López LA", "Higareda-Almaraz E", "García-López NA"], "topic": "Teenage Pregnancy", "title": "Trends in Teen Births in Mexico Spanning 25 Years: A Need for Regionally-directed Preventive Strategies.", "publication": "Arch Med Res. 2019 Apr;50(3):142-150. doi: 10.1016/j.arcmed.2019.07.008.

Therefore, the American joint committee on cancer`s latest manual for classification and staging of cancer suggests a separate staging system for HPV positive oropharyngeal cancers. Despite the younger patients being affected and the high propensity for cervical metastasis, the HPV positive oropharyngeal cancers respond much better to the treatment. The association with wild type TP53 and low EGFR expression confers the favorable prognosis in HPV driven HNSCC. Since the association is not universal, we suggest checking for p53 and EGFR expression status before considering de-intensification of therapy. In addition, the presence of matted lymph nodes and five or more nodes could mean relatively poorer prognosis, and are not suitable for de-intensification of therapy. The same is also true probably with higher T stage and co-existing tobacco use. The methods for the detection of p16, HPV DNA, HPV E6/E7 mRNA, anti-E6/E7 antibodies, in tissue, in serum and in saliva of patients, along with their clinical implications are also discussed.\nSIGNIFICANCE:\nThis article provides latest developments on the HPV driven HNSCC.

However, across the board, clinical responses have been achieved in only a limited subset of cancer patients, underscoring a critical need to identify mechanisms and biomarkers of response, as well as mechanisms of resistance to therapy. Cancers caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) are driven by two viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7, both of which are functionally required for cellular transformation, thereby providing non-'self', tumor-specific antigenic targets. Immune responses that are specific for either or both of these oncoproteins can be used to follow the magnitude and kinetics of immune responses to therapeutic interventions. Moreover, identifying neoantigens is not a concern in early-stage disease - since HPV cancers are driven by HPV oncoproteins, the somatic mutational load in early disease is low, particularly in comparison to non-HPV-related squamous cancers arising in the same organ site [1,2]. Cancers caused by HPV are a model clinical setting in which to test principles of immunotherapies, and to discover mechanisms of interactions between tumors and their attendant immune milieu. In this review, we will use examples of insights gained from studies of HPV disease to illustrate major themes of immune-based therapeutic strategies.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Among them, Chinese women have a higher cervical cancer incidence and mortality rate than the global average, with mortality rates being almost twice the global average. However, the current approach of HPV vaccination in China is not satisfactory given the high disease burden of cervical cancer. The current study is a randomized controlled trial designed to identify the barriers and facilitators of HPV vaccination among Chinese female students. This study will also test a health intervention measure via a popular form of new media in order to improve the HPV vaccine uptake under the framework of Information-Motivation-Behavioral skill Model (IMB).\nMETHODS:\nThis investigation is a multicenter, school-based, prospective, randomized, parallel group, double-blind, blank-controlled trial involving a 7-day education intervention with a further 6-month follow-up. We will enroll at least 3360 participants older than 18 years. The enrolled participants will be randomly divided into two groups (1:1 ratio). The intervention group will be offered a 7-day mobile health education, and participants in both groups will fill out 4 questionnaires at the baseline, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after the intervention. The primary outcome is the difference in HPV vaccination or reservation for the HPV vaccine between the intervention and control groups. Secondary outcomes will include the comparison of (1) knowledge, attitudes, motivation, beliefs and behavioral skill about HPV and cervical cancer prevention, and (2) the willingness to uptake HPV vaccination.\nDISCUSSION:\nThis study will examine the theory-based intervention in improving HPV vaccination among Chinese female college students. We will conduct the randomized controlled trial to provide scientific evidence on the potential effect of the IMB theory-based intervention.

The role of the immune system in viral recognition and elimination is of extreme relevance in the development of CC. The interactions of the HLA-E ligand in the target cell along with CD94/NKG2 receptors, which are expressed predominantly, but not exclusively, on NK cells' surface, are responsible for activating or inhibiting cytotoxic activity according to their function. The engagement between HLA-E and CD94/NKG2 molecules is one of the fundamental surveillance mechanisms in patients with CIN I, II and III, where HLA-E expression increases significantly, especially in HPV 16 and 18 infections. Higher HLA-E expression was observed in most histopathological types of CC, and at the same time was correlated to best survival of the patient.

The challenges in introducing quality cytology screening in LMICs led to the evaluation of alternative screening approaches such as visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing-based screening. Large-scale clinical trials have generated sufficient evidence of efficacy of HPV-based screening for the introduction as the primary technology in cervical cancer screening. Being more objective, automated with better sensitivity than cytology requiring fewer rounds of screening and opportunity for self-sampling, HPV testing is thus poised to be more cost-effective in providing opportunity for wider coverage, making it ideal for incorporating into primary screening programs of LMIC settings that could help reduce regional disparities.

The most important risk factor for the development of CC is cervical infection with human papilloma virus (HPV). Inflammation is a protective strategy that is triggered by the host against pathogens such as viral infections that acts rapidly to activate the innate immune response. Inflammation is beneficial if it is brief and well controlled; however, if the inflammation is excessive or it becomes of chronic duration, it can produce detrimental effects. HPV proteins are involved, both directly and indirectly, in the development of chronic inflammation, which is a causal factor in the development of CC. However, other factors may also have a potential role in stimulating chronic inflammation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) (a class of noncoding RNAs) are strong regulators of gene expression. They have emerged as key players in several biological processes, including inflammatory pathways. Abnormal expression of miRNAs may be linked to the induction of inflammation that occurs in CC. Exosomes are a subset of extracellular vesicles shed by almost all types of cells, which can function as cargo transfer vehicles. Exosomes contain proteins and genetic material (including miRNAs) derived from their parent cells and can potentially affect recipient cells. Exosomes have recently been recognized to be involved in inflammatory processes and can also affect the immune response. In this review, we discuss the role of HPV proteins, miRNAs and exosomes in the inflammation associated with CC.\n© 2019 UICC.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6999596/"}, {"references": null, "authors": ["Gilham C", "Sargent A", "Peto J"], "topic": "HPV", "title": "Triaging women with human papillomavirus infection and normal cytology or low-grade dyskaryosis: evidence from 10-year follow up of the ARTISTIC trial cohort.", "publication": "BJOG. 2020 Jan;127(1):58-68. doi: 10.1111/1471-0528.15957.

Cervical cancer is the third most common cancer in women worldwide; about 70% of cervical cancer cases are caused by the high-risk HPVs (HR HPVs) of genotypes 16 and 18. HPV infection occurs mainly through sexual contact; however, viral transmission via horizontal and vertical pathways is also possible. After HPV infection of basal keratinocytes or ecto-endocervical transition zone cells, viral DNA persists in the episomal form. In most cases, infected cells are eliminated by the immune system. Occasionally, elimination fails, and HPV infection becomes chronic. Replication of HPVs in dividing epithelial cells is accompanied by increased expression of the E6 and E7 oncoproteins. These oncoproteins are responsible for genomic instability, disruption of the cell cycle, cell proliferation, immortalization, and malignant transformation of HPV-infected cells. Besides, E6 and E7 oncoproteins induce immunosuppression, preventing the detection of HPV-infected and transformed cells by the immune system. HPV integration into the genome of the host cell leads to the upregulation of E6 and E7 expression and contributes to HPV-associated malignization. Prophylactic HPV vaccines can prevent over 80% of HPV-associated anogenital cancers. The vaccine elicits immune response that prevents initial infection with a given HPV type but does not eliminate persistent virus once infection has occurred and does not prevent development of the HPV-associated neoplasias, which necessitates the development of therapeutic vaccines to treat chronic HPV infections and HPV-associated malignancies.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1134/S0006297919070095"}, {"references": null, "authors": ["Mimouni F", "Lakshminrusimha S", "Pearlman SA", "Raju T", "Gallagher PG", "Mendlovic J"], "topic": "Infections and Pregnancy", "title": "Perinatal aspects on the covid-19 pandemic: a practical resource for perinatal-neonatal specialists.", "publication": "J Perinatol. 2020 May;40(5):820-826. doi: 10.1038/s41372-020-0665-6.

In women affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the case fatality rate appears higher in those affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. We conducted a rapid review to guide health policy and management of women affected by COVID-19 during pregnancy, which was used to develop the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' (RCOG) guidelines on COVID-19 infection in pregnancy.\nMETHODS:\nSearches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies and randomized controlled trials describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy. Data were extracted from relevant papers. This review has been used to develop guidelines with representatives of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) and RCOG who provided expert consensus on areas in which data were lacking.\nRESULTS:\nFrom 9965 search results in PubMed and 600 in MedRxiv, 21 relevant studies, all of which were case reports or case series, were identified. From reports of 32 women to date affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering 30 babies (one set of twins, three ongoing pregnancies), seven (22%) were asymptomatic and two (6%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), one of whom remained on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. No maternal deaths have been reported to date. Delivery was by Cesarean section in 27 cases and by vaginal delivery in two, and 15 (47%) delivered preterm. There was one stillbirth and one neonatal death. In 25 babies, no cases of vertical transmission were reported; 15 were reported as being tested with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction after delivery. Case fatality rates for SARS and MERS were 15% and 27%, respectively. SARS was associated with miscarriage or intrauterine death in five cases, and fetal growth restriction was noted in two ongoing pregnancies affected by SARS in the third trimester.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nSerious morbidity occurred in 2/32 women with COVID-19, both of whom required ICU care. Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 appears less lethal, acknowledging the limited number of cases reported to date and that one woman remains in a critical condition. Preterm delivery affected 47% of women hospitalized with COVID-19, which may put considerable pressure on neonatal services if the UK's reasonable worst-case scenario of 80% of the population being affected is realized. Based on this review, RCOG, in consultation with RCPCH, developed guidance for delivery and neonatal care in pregnancies affected by COVID-19, which recommends that delivery mode be determined primarily by obstetric indication and recommends against routine separation of affected mothers and their babies. We hope that this review will be helpful for maternity and neonatal services planning their response to COVID-19. © 2020 The Authors.

Limited data are available about coronavirus disease 2019 during pregnancy; however, information on illnesses associated with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses (ie, severe acute respiratory syndrome and the Middle East respiratory syndrome) might provide insights into coronavirus disease 2019's effects during pregnancy. Coronaviruses cause illness ranging in severity from the common cold to severe respiratory illness and death. Currently the primary epidemiologic risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 include travel from mainland China (especially Hubei Province) or close contact with infected individuals within 14 days of symptom onset. Data suggest an incubation period of ∼5 days (range, 2-14 days). Average age of hospitalized patients has been 49-56 years, with a third to half with an underlying illness. Children have been rarely reported. Men were more frequent among hospitalized cases (54-73%). Frequent manifestations include fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and diarrhea. Abnormal testing includes abnormalities on chest radiographic imaging, lymphopenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Initial reports suggest that acute respiratory distress syndrome develops in 17-29% of hospitalized patients. Overall case fatality rate appears to be ∼1%; however, early data may overestimate this rate. In 2 reports describing 18 pregnancies with coronavirus disease 2019, all were infected in the third trimester, and clinical findings were similar to those in nonpregnant adults. Fetal distress and preterm delivery were seen in some cases. All but 2 pregnancies were cesarean deliveries and no evidence of in utero transmission was seen. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome in pregnancy are sparse. For severe acute respiratory syndrome, the largest series of 12 pregnancies had a case-fatality rate of 25%. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome in 4, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in 3, renal failure in 3, secondary bacterial pneumonia in 2, and sepsis in 2 patients. Mechanical ventilation was 3 times more likely among pregnant compared with nonpregnant women. Among 7 first-trimester infections, 4 ended in spontaneous abortion. Four of 5 women with severe acute respiratory syndrome after 24 weeks' gestation delivered preterm. For Middle East respiratory syndrome, there were 13 case reports in pregnant women, of which 2 were asymptomatic, identified as part of a contact investigation; 3 patients (23%) died. Two pregnancies ended in fetal demise and 2 were born preterm. No evidence of in utero transmission was seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome. Currently no coronavirus-specific treatments have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Because coronavirus disease 2019 might increase the risk for pregnancy complications, management should optimally be in a health care facility with close maternal and fetal monitoring. Principles of management of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy include early isolation, aggressive infection control procedures, oxygen therapy, avoidance of fluid overload, consideration of empiric antibiotics (secondary to bacterial infection risk), laboratory testing for the virus and coinfection, fetal and uterine contraction monitoring, early mechanical ventilation for progressive respiratory failure, individualized delivery planning, and a team-based approach with multispecialty consultations. Information on coronavirus disease 2019 is increasing rapidly.

Most women with bacterial vaginosis are unaware of the infection, making it difficult to diagnose in the absence of a microscopic examination of vaginal discharge or using point-of-care testing. Untreated bacterial vaginosis elevates the risk of postoperative surgical infections in women undergoing obstetric and gynecological procedures. Treatment with antimicrobial agents that target bacterial vaginosis has been shown to reduce the rate of postoperative infections following hysterectomy and surgical abortions. Furthermore, in a cost-comparison model, screening for and treatment of bacterial vaginosis prior to hysterectomy was shown to be superior to no screening in terms of infection rates and cost. The bacterial vaginosis diagnostic criteria are simple and screening tests are inexpensive; bacterial vaginosis screening is a relatively fast process in patients who present for preoperative appointments. Treatment options approved by the Food and Drug Administration include metronidazole, clindamycin, tinidazole, and secnidazole. Given the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and the risks associated with operating on a woman with untreated bacterial vaginosis, women undergoing hysterectomy, surgical abortion, and potentially cesarean delivery should be screened for bacterial vaginosis, and those who screen positive should be treated with an appropriate antimicrobial agent.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Ureaplasma spp. are among the smallest organisms, and their isolation is uncommon in routine clinical practice because of their size and high auxotrophy. Although Ureaplasma spp. have been reported as causative agents of preterm birth, they also have a high incidence in vaginal swabs collected from healthy reproductive-age women; this has led to questions on the virulence of Ureaplasma spp. and to them being considered as harmless commensal bacteria. Therefore, many efforts have been made to clarify the pathogenicity of Ureaplasma spp. at the molecular level. Ureaplasma spp. are surrounded by lipoproteins, including multiple-banded antigen. Both multiple-banded antigen and its derivative, that is, the synthetic lipopeptide, UPM-1, induce an inflammatory response in a preterm mice model, which was adequate to cause preterm birth or stillbirth. In this review, we present an overview of the virulence mechanisms of Ureaplasma spp. and treatment of ureaplasma infection during pregnancy to prevent possible serious sequelae in infants. In addition, relevant mechanisms underlying antibiotic resistance in Ureaplasma spp. are discussed.

No studies evaluated the benefits or harms of screening. Twenty-five studies (n = 15 785) evaluated the accuracy of screening tests; across individual studies and tests, sensitivity ranged from 0.36 to 1.0 and specificity ranged from 0.49 to 1.0. Among trials reporting findings from general obstetric populations (n = 7953), no significant association was observed between treatment and spontaneous delivery before 37 weeks (pooled absolute risk difference [ARD], -1.44% [95% CI, -3.31% to 0.43%]; 8 RCTs, n = 7571) or any delivery before 37 weeks (pooled ARD, 0.20% [95% CI, -1.13% to 1.53%]; 6 RCTs, n = 6307). Among 5 trials reporting findings among women with a prior preterm delivery, findings were inconsistent; 3 showed a significant beneficial effect, while 2 did not. Maternal adverse events from treatment were infrequent and minor (eg, candidiasis) but were slightly more common with active treatment compared with placebo across 8 RCTs. Two meta-analyses of observational studies reported no significant association between metronidazole exposure and congenital malformations (odds ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.75 to 1.22]; odds ratio, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.90 to 1.29]).

However, many women leave without a clear diagnosis or experience recurrent symptoms despite treatment. The 3 most common etiologies of vaginitis are trichomonas, bacterial vaginosis, and vulvovaginal candidiasis, which account for an estimated 70% of cases. The remaining 30% may be related to other causes of vaginitis, including atrophic vaginitis, desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, and vaginal erosive disease. The purpose of this review is to describe the noncandidal causes of acute and recurrent vaginitis, with the goal of improving the likelihood of accurate diagnosis as well as efficient and effective therapy. We excluded candidal vaginitis from our review because there was a recently published review on this topic in the Journal. The clinical presentation and evaluation of patients with symptoms of vaginitis can be triaged into 1 of 2 diagnostic pathways: noninflammatory and inflammatory vaginitis. The most common noninflammatory cause is bacterial vaginosis. Features such as irritation, purulent discharge, and the presence of polymorphonuclear neutrophils are more suggestive of an inflammatory process. Trichomoniasis is the most common cause of inflammatory vaginitis. Other well-described forms of inflammatory vaginitis include atrophic vaginitis, desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, and erosive disease. We present a review of the pathogenesis, symptoms, examination findings, diagnostic testing, and treatment for each of these causes of noncandidal vaginitis.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Most women with bacterial vaginosis are unaware of the infection, making it difficult to diagnose in the absence of a microscopic examination of vaginal discharge or using point-of-care testing. Untreated bacterial vaginosis elevates the risk of postoperative surgical infections in women undergoing obstetric and gynecological procedures. Treatment with antimicrobial agents that target bacterial vaginosis has been shown to reduce the rate of postoperative infections following hysterectomy and surgical abortions. Furthermore, in a cost-comparison model, screening for and treatment of bacterial vaginosis prior to hysterectomy was shown to be superior to no screening in terms of infection rates and cost. The bacterial vaginosis diagnostic criteria are simple and screening tests are inexpensive; bacterial vaginosis screening is a relatively fast process in patients who present for preoperative appointments. Treatment options approved by the Food and Drug Administration include metronidazole, clindamycin, tinidazole, and secnidazole. Given the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and the risks associated with operating on a woman with untreated bacterial vaginosis, women undergoing hysterectomy, surgical abortion, and potentially cesarean delivery should be screened for bacterial vaginosis, and those who screen positive should be treated with an appropriate antimicrobial agent.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Only women with a pretreatment Nugent score of 7-10 and a valid posttreatment Nugent score (N=55) were included in metronidazole treatment failure analyses, with treatment failure defined as a posttreatment Nugent score of 4-10.\nRESULTS:\nThe bacterial vaginosis cure rate by Nugent scoring was 54.5%. The mean total vaginal bacterial concentration declined from 6.59 to 5.85 log10/μL (P<.001), which was mostly due to a reduction in mean bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobes concentration (all bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobe taxa combined) from 6.23 to 4.55 log10/μL (P<.001). However, only 16.4% of women had a bacterial vaginosis anaerobes concentration reduction of more than 50%, and only 3 women had complete eradication. The mean concentration of lactobacilli (all species combined) increased from 4.98 to 5.56 log10/μL (P=.017), with L. iners being the most common species pre- and posttreatment. The mean concentration of pathobionts (defined as Proteobacteria, streptococci, staphylococci, enterococci, and a few others) did not change significantly: from 1.92 log10/μL pretreatment to 2.01 log10/μL posttreatment (P=.939).

For this reason, we provide an overview of therapies prescribed in dermatology that may increase the risk for candidiasis, and we review the literature on whether probiotics are useful in the treatment and prevention of oral and vulvovaginal candidiasis to help dermatologists treating the condition be better informed about their supplemental use with conventional antifungals.\n© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/dth.12970"}, {"references": null, "authors": ["Genovese C", "Cianci A", "Corsello S", "Ettore G", "Mattana P", "Tempera G"], "topic": "Vaginitis", "title": "Combined systemic (fluconazole) and topical (metronidazole + clotrimazole) therapy for a new approach to the treatment and prophylaxis of recurrent candidiasis.", "publication": "Minerva Ginecol. 2019 Aug;71(4):321-328. doi: 10.23736/S0026-4784.19.04388-0.

Clinical and epidemiological studies show that different types of therapies are able to eliminate the signs and symptoms of mycotic vaginitis in the acute phase, but so far none of these has proved able to significantly reduce the risk of long-term recurrence. In this review, based on the available literature and original data from a preliminary in-vitro microbiological study on the compatibility between fluconazole, clotrimazole and metronidazole a new therapeutic approach to RVVC is discussed and presented. The treatment proposed is a combined scheme using both systemic antimicrobial drug therapy with oral fluconazole 200 mg and topical drug therapy using the association metronidazole 500 mg and clotrimazole 100 mg (vaginal ovules) with adjuvant oral probiotic therapy. In detail, at the time of diagnosis in the acute symptom phase, we propose the following treatment scheme: fluconazole 200 mg on day 1, 4, 11, 26, then 1 dose/month for 3 months at the end of the menstrual cycle; plus metronidazole/clotrimazole ovules 1/day for 6 days the first week, then 1 ovule/day for 3 days the week before the menstrual cycle for 3 months; plus probiotic 1 dose/day for 10 days for 3 months starting from the second month to the end of the menstrual cycle. This scheme aims to address the recurrent infection aggressively from the outset by attempting not only to treat acute symptoms, but also to prevent a new event by countering many of the potential risk factors of recurrence, such as the intestinal Candida reservoir, the mycotic biorhythm, the formation of biofilm, the phenotype switching and the presence of infections complicated by the presence of C. non albicans or G. Vaginalis, without interfering, but rather favoring the restoration of the vaginal lactobacillus species. Future clinical studies will be useful to confirm the proposed scheme.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.23736/S0026-4784.19.04388-0"}, {"references": null, "authors": ["Dahoud W", "Michael CW", "Gokozan H", "Nakanishi AK", "Harbhajanka A"], "topic": "Vaginitis", "title": "Association of Bacterial Vaginosis and Human Papilloma Virus Infection With Cervical Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions.", "publication": "Am J Clin Pathol. 2019 Jul 5;152(2):185-189. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqz021.", "abstract": "Abstract\nOBJECTIVES:\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) is known to be associated with squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs).

We aimed to determine whether, when maternal levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were taken into account, children born to mothers who had received 4400 IU of vitamin D3 per day during pregnancy (vitamin D group) would have a lower incidence of asthma and recurrent wheeze at the age of 6 years than would those born to mothers who had received 400 IU of vitamin D3 per day (control group). Time-to-event methods were used to compare the treatment groups with respect to time to the onset of asthma or recurrent wheeze. Multivariate methods were used to compare longitudinal measures of lung function between the treatment groups.\nRESULTS:\nThere was no effect of maternal vitamin D supplementation on asthma and recurrent wheeze in either an intention-to-treat analysis or an analysis with stratification according to the maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level during pregnancy. There was no effect of prenatal vitamin D supplementation on most of the prespecified secondary outcomes. We found no effects of prenatal supplementation on spirometric indexes. Although there was a very small effect on airway resistance as measured by impulse oscillometry, this finding was of uncertain significance.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nVitamin D supplementation during the prenatal period alone did not influence the 6-year incidence of asthma and recurrent wheeze among children who were at risk for asthma.

Assessments were completed on 629 18-year-old first-born offspring to evaluate these primary outcomes: (1) cognitive-related abilities (nonverbal intelligence, receptive language, and math achievement) and (2) behavioral health (internalizing behavioral problems, substance use and abuse, sexually transmitted infections, HIV risk, arrests, convictions, and gang membership).\nRESULTS:\nCompared with control-group counterparts, NV youth born to mothers with LPR had better receptive language (effect size = 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.00 to 0.47; P = .05), math achievement (effect size = 0.38; 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.61; P = .002), and a number of secondary cognitive-related outcomes.

We hypothesized that nurse-visitation would lead to long-term reductions in public-benefit costs, maternal substance abuse and depression, and that cost-savings would be greater for mothers with initially higher psychological resources.\nMETHODS:\nWe conducted an 18-year follow-up of 618 out of 742 low-income, primarily African-American mothers with no previous live births enrolled in an randomized clinical trial of prenatal and infancy home visiting by nurses. We compared nurse-visited and control-group women for public-benefit costs, rates of substance abuse and depression, and examined possible mediators of intervention effects.\nRESULTS:\nNurse-visited women, compared with controls, incurred $17 310 less in public benefit costs (P = .03), an effect more pronounced for women with higher psychological resources ($28 847, P = .01). These savings compare with program costs of $12 578. There were no program effects on substance abuseor depression. Nurse-visited women were more likely to be married from child age 2 through 18 (19.2% vs 14.8%, P = .04), and those with higher psychological resources had 4.64 fewer cumulative years rearing subsequent children after the birth of the first child (P = .03). Pregnancy planning was a significant mediator of program effects on public benefit costs.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThrough child age 18, the program reduced public-benefit costs, an effect more pronounced for mothers with higher psychological resources and mediated by subsequent pregnancy planning.

A pretest/posttest, quasi-experimental design was used with pregnant self-identified Mexican-American Latinas at 14-20 weeks' gestation. Measures of anxiety, depressive symptoms, and positive and negative coping were used.\nRESULTS:\nFeasibility was a success in terms of implementation of the MLI in an active prenatal clinic setting and the use of electronic tablets for data collection and entry of data into REDcap. Satisfaction was high, with the location of the MLI being at their primary OB/GYN clinic. Participants reported that six intervention sessions appear to be ideal as was the class length of 1.5 to 2 hours. On Cohen's d, there were medium to large effect size decreases in depressive and anxiety symptoms and small to medium effect size decreases in the use of negative coping strategies and small effect sizes for increases in positive coping strategies.\nDISCUSSION:\nPilot testing of the MLI indicated that it was well accepted from the participants and feasible as a culturally tailored behavioral therapy administered in a group setting by nurse practitioners.

Research design/setting: Focused ethnography with data collection methods commensurate with a qualitative research design.\nSETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:\nData was collected in three districts in Timor-Leste. Participants included seventeen stakeholders, health professionals and managers providing skilled birth attendance (SBA) in Timor-Leste and thirty women who have given birth and are competent to give consent.\nFINDINGS:\nAccess to SBA services is seriously impeded by poor roads and lack of transportation, the poor condition and amenity of services, restricted hours of opening, the lack of availability of skilled SBA professionals and medical resources. Participants also commented upon the lack of privacy and multiple caregivers. Timorese patriarchal family structures, intergenerational decision-making and cultural attitudes towards reproductive health information and services potentially reduce women's access to reproductive health services.\nCONCLUSION:\nThis data provides a comprehensive record of the multiple structural barriers to women's access to SBA services. The modified AAAQA framework provides categories and an organisational structure to these barriers to SBA services.\nIMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:\nMaternity care in Timor-Leste is extremely poorly resourced. Midwives and other SBA will need to provide innovative low cost solutions if they are to consistently provide respectful culturally safe midwifery care. This includes the provision of privacy and a one to one midwifery relationship `with woman'. In addition, many women are unable to access SBA, where possible the MoH can consider strategies to improve the provision of SBA services to women birthing in community.\nCrown Copyright © 2019.

Epub 2019 Oct 1.", "abstract": "Abstract\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo provide an understanding of the influential components required for the planning, delivery and evaluation of antenatal weight management programmes for women who are overweight or obese.\nDESIGN:\nTwo phase sequential explanatory mixed methods design comprising of an online survey and one-to-one telephone interviews.\nSETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:\nAll UK maternity services (n = 168) and local government councils (n = 417).\nFINDINGS:\nFrom the 378 responses, 49 maternity services and 28 local government councils reported having an antenatal weight management programme. Of the 62 responses that specified BMI as an inclusion criterion only two-fifths (40.3% n = 25) adhered to the recommended threshold to include women with a BMI ≥30 kg/m2. Although having a multi-disciplinary team was identified as fundamental when planning a programme, only 20.6% (n = 14/68) of the programmes involved service users during the planning phase. How the programme was communicated to a woman was a key factor which determined whether she partook in the programme or not. Having administrative support and staff with expertise in data collection were essential when evaluating a programme. Staff having protected time was identified as important when planning, delivering and evaluating a programme. Three overarching themes were identified from the individual interviews (n = 14) 'choices and decisions', 'demands and resources' and 'engagement and disengagement'.\nKEY CONCLUSIONS:\nNational guidelines recommendations regarding service user involvement when planning programmes and the BMI threshold used for inclusion are not being met. In addition to having adequate time, personnel and finances, successful programmes are dependent on the confidence and communication skills of midwives to raise the issue of obesity with these women at the booking appointment. Without staff having the time and necessary knowledge and skills, evaluation, and hence demonstrating programme impact, will likely remain difficult. Organisational support is needed to release resources to plan, deliver and evaluate these programmes. Strategic communication strategies are needed to promote the programme to both women and staff within organisations. Future programmes need to ensure there is engagement with service users from the planning of the programme through to evaluation.\nCopyright © 2019.
