This meta-analysis is designed to examine the clinical analgesic efficacy of Pecs block in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery.\nMETHODS:\nAn electronic literature search of the Library of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases was conducted to collect randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from inception to November 2018. These RCTs compared the effect of Pecs block in combination with general anesthesia (GA) to GA alone in mastectomy surgery. Pain scores, intraoperative and postoperative opioid consumption, time to first request for analgesia, and incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting were analyzed.\nRESULTS:\nThirteen RCTs with 940 patients were included in our analysis. The use of Pecs block significantly reduced pain scores in the postanesthesia care unit (weighted mean difference [WMD] = -1.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.90 to -0.91; P < .001) and at 24 hours after surgery (WMD = -1.01; 95% CI, -1.64 to -0.38; P < .001). Moreover, Pecs block decreased postoperative opioid consumption in the postanesthesia care unit (WMD = -1.93; 95% CI, -3.51 to -0.34; P = .017) and at 24 hours (WMD = -11.88; 95% CI, -15.50 to -8.26; P < .001). Pecs block also reduced intraoperative opioid consumption (WMD = -85.52; 95% CI, -121.47 to -49.56; P < .001) and prolonged the time to first analgesic request (WMD = 296.69; 95% CI, 139.91-453.48; P < .001).

Breast prosthesis can improve patient's figure externally, increase self-confidence, thus improving quality of life (QOL). Prospective study of different breast prostheses has not yet been performed in China. Our objective was to evaluate the QOL of patients wearing different types of breast prostheses and to compare the physical and psychological effects of different temperature-controlled breast prostheses on patients.\nMETHODS:\nThirty patients with breast cancer were recruited through the Yankang E-follow-up Platform at the Department of Breast Surgery of Fudan University, Shanghai Cancer Center and were randomized into either intervention or control group. Random number tables were used in this study for randomization. In the first 6 weeks of the study, self-adhesive breast prostheses and conventional breast prostheses had been used in the intervention and control group, respectively. In the later 6 weeks, the breast prostheses used were switched into another kind. Several dimensional parameters including skin conditions, breast prosthesis knowledge, breast prosthesis knowledge, QOL, and body image were examined by different questionnaires in the end of both 6th and 12th week.\nRESULTS:\nThere were no significant difference in QOL and body image between the 2 groups during 6th and 12th week. At the 6th week of the study, patients of the intervention group preferred to the self-adhesive breast prosthesis, indicating that the self-adhesive breast prosthesis seemed more likely to feel like part of their body, while prosthesis cleaning remaining their biggest concern. At the end of 12th week, in comparison with the number at 6th week, more patients in both groups were willing to choose self-adhesive breast prosthesis.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nWe conclude that women are satisfied with the temperature-controlled breast prosthesis and are more willing to choose self-adhesive breast prostheses although cleaning remains a problem. In China, patients still lack information about breast prostheses. Therefore, specialist breast nurses should provide comprehensive information about breast prostheses, assist patients in selecting suitable breast prostheses, collect feedback about the prostheses, and reduce each patient's physical and mental discomfort."}, {"authors": ["Qiu H", "Xu WH", "Kong J", "Ding XJ", "Chen DF"], "topic": "Mastectomy", "title": "Effect of breast-conserving surgery and modified radical mastectomy on operation index, symptom checklist-90 score and prognosis in patients with early breast cancer.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000019279", "publication": "Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Mar;99(11):e19279. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000019279.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nThe present study aims to analyze the effects of breast-conserving surgery and modified radical mastectomy on operation indexes, Symptom checklist-90 scores and prognosis in patients with early breast cancer.The clinical data of 128 patients with breast cancer who were treated in our hospital from May 2015 to May 2016 were included into the analysis.

Quantification of lymphatic contractility has previously been shown using a custom-built near-infrared imaging system. However, to broaden the clinical use of functional lymphatic measurements, these measurements need to be performed using a standard-of-care, clinically available camera. The authors propose an objective, algorithmic, and clinically accessible approach to quantify lymphatic contractility using a 3-minute indocyanine green lymphangiograph recorded with a commercially available near-infrared camera. A retrospective review of the authors' indocyanine green lymphangiography video repository maintained in a Research Electronic Data Capture database was performed. All patients with a newly diagnosed unilateral breast cancer undergoing preoperative indocyanine green lymphangiography were included in the analysis. Patient medical records were then analyzed for patient demographics, and videos were analyzed for contractility. Seventeen consecutive patients with unilateral breast cancers underwent video processing to quantify lymphatic contractility of the ipsilateral extremity in contractions per minute. All patients were women, with an average age of 60.5 years (range, 38 to 84 years). The average lymphatic contractility rate was 1.13 contractions per minute (range, 0.67 to 2.5 contractions per minute). Using a clinically accessible standard-of-care device for indocyanine green lymphangiography, the authors were able to determine lymphatic contractility rates of a normal extremity. The authors' finding falls within the range of previously published data quantifying lymphatic contractility using a research device, suggesting that the authors' technique provides a clinically accessible, time-effective means of assessing lymphatic contractility.

Costs were retrieved from supplier price lists, physician fee schedules, lymphedema therapists, and literature reviews. The net present value of all costs incurred for each clinical pathway were calculated.\nRESULTS:\nThe estimated net present value of all costs for a patient with breast cancer-related lymphedema undergoing treatment were as follows: (1) complete decongestive therapy alone ($30,400); (2) lymphovenous bypass no longer requiring ongoing complete decongestive therapy ($15,000); or (3) lymphovenous bypass requiring ongoing complete decongestive therapy ($42,100). The expected net present value of all costs for lymphovenous bypass was $26,800, which was comparable to that of complete decongestive therapy alone. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the expected net present value of lymphovenous bypass was dependent on the patient's life expectancy, number of bypass anastomoses, and likelihood of discontinuing complete decongestive therapy.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nLymphedema has substantial ongoing costs irrespective of the treatment modality. The cost of lymphovenous bypass appears comparable to that of complete decongestive therapy alone-the surgical costs of lymphovenous bypass are offset by the savings from discontinued ongoing therapy.

In patients undergoing mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction, there is concern that this treatment could increase postoperative complications. The authors characterize which patients are at a higher risk of experiencing a postoperative complication, and assess the impact of postoperative complications on timing of radiation treatment.\nMETHODS:\nA retrospective review was performed on patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction using tissue expanders. Multivariable binomial logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for experiencing a postoperative complication. Independent samples t tests were used to compare means for neoadjuvant chemotherapy timing and time to commencement of radiation therapy between patients with and without complications.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 128 patients were identified. Patients that experienced a complication had a statistically significant difference in time to commencement of radiation therapy (p = 0.021) and an elevated body mass index (p = 0.018) compared with patients who experienced no complication; there was no difference in timing interval of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.692). Logistic regression showed an associate between body mass index and postoperative complication (OR, 1.09; 95 percent CI, 1.018 to 1.167; p = 0.013).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nPostoperative complications delay the commencement of radiation therapy in patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and undergo mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction. The period from the last dose of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was equivalent between those that experienced postoperative complications and those that did not. Patients with a higher body mass index are more likely to experience postoperative complications, and this should be considered when offering tissue expanders to obese patients who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and require adjuvant radiation treatment.\nCLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:\nRisk, III."}, {"authors": ["Lee YS", "Lee HS", "Chang SW", "Lee CU", "Kim JS", "Jung YK", "Kim JH", "Seo YS", "Yim HJ", "Lee CH", "Woo SU", "Seo JH", "Yeon JE", "Um SH", "Byun KS"], "topic": "Mastectomy", "title": "Underlying nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a significant factor for breast cancer recurrence after curative surgery.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6775430/", "publication": "Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Sep;98(39):e17277. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000017277.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nBreast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, and it is a main cause of death in women.

Data variables were grouped into general, treatment-specific, cancer-specific, and follow-up variables and were matched. As proof-of-concept, mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction rates in patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ were analyzed.\nRESULTS:\nThe NBCA included 115 variables and SEER included 112. The NBCA included significantly more treatment-specific variables (n = 46 versus 6), whereas the SEER database included more cancer-specific variables (n = 74 versus 26). In patients diagnosed with breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ, immediate breast reconstruction was performed in 19.3 percent and 24.0 percent of the breast cancer cohort and 44.0 percent and 35.3 percent of the ductal carcinoma in situ cohort in the NBCA and SEER, respectively. Immediate breast reconstruction rates increased significantly over time in both data sets.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThis study provides a first overview of available registry data on breast cancer care in The Netherlands and the United States, and revealed limited data on treatment in the United States. Comparison of treatment patterns of immediate breast reconstruction showed interesting differences.

Initial doubts over the efficacy and safety of PMRT in these patients were partially overcome by improvement in technology and systemic treatments. Several randomized controlled clinical trials confirmed benefit of PMRT in N1 patients, which were meta-analyzed by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG). This meta-analysis provides the sole high-level evidence to guide clinical decision-making. PRESENT: Nevertheless, concerns have been evoked around these results, most notably concerning the patient selection bias and the era in which the patients were treated. More recent studies, albeit retrospective, are in contrast with this level I evidence, unequivocally reporting inferior recurrence rates in control arms than those of the EBCTCG meta-analysis. Taken together, these results suggest that one solution would not fit all N1 patients and that patient selection for PMRT shall be stratified upon risks factors. Most prominent of such factors identified are: patient age; number and ratio of positive lymph nodes; histological features such as lymphovascular invasion; and hormone receptor expression. FUTURE: A prospective randomized controlled trial SUPREMO will release its final results in 2023 and shed light onto the subject. Genomic tumor cell profiling will likely provide further guidelines in terms of risk stratification. SUPREMO translational sub-study will also offer material for genomic analyses. A cross-field tendency to forgo nodal dissection in favor of sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by nodal irradiation might eventually render the question of PMRT indication after ALND irrelevant.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To address unmet needs for contraception information and services, a community-based, gender-sensitive and culturally adapted brief counselling intervention (SIRIAN program) was launched in some deprived neighbourhoods with a high proportion of immigrants in Barcelona. Once a randomized controlled trial demonstrated its effectiveness in increasing the use of contraceptives, we aim to examine its population impact on adolescent fertility rates.\nMETHODS:\nQuasi-experimental study with comparison group, using population data from 2005 to 2016. Five neighbourhoods in the lowest tercile of Disposable Household Income were intervened in 2011-13. The comparison group included the three neighbourhoods which were in the same municipal district and in the lowest Disposable Household Income tercile, and displayed the highest adolescent fertility rates. Generalized linear models were fitted to assess absolute adolescent fertility rates and adjusted by immigrant population between pre-intervention (2005-10) and post-intervention periods (2011-16); Difference in Differences and relative pre-post changes analysis were performed.\nRESULTS:\nIn 2005-10 the intervention group adolescent fertility rate was 27.90 (per 1000 women 15-19) and 21.84 in the comparison group. In 2011-16 intervention areas experienced great declines (adolescent fertility rate change: - 12.30 (- 12.45 to - 12.21); p < 0.001), while comparison neighbourhoods remained unchanged (adolescent fertility rate change: 1.91 (- 2.25 to 6.07); p = 0.368). A reduction of - 10.97 points (- 13.91 to - 8.03); p < 0.001) is associated to the intervention.\nCONCLUSION:\nAdolescent fertility rate significantly declined in the intervention group but remained stable in the comparison group. This quasi-experimental study provide evidence that, in a country with universal health coverage, a community counselling intervention that increases access to contraception, knowledge and sexual health care in hard-to-reach segments of the population can contribute to substantially reduce adolescent fertility rates.

The WC and mass media campaign were introduced simultaneously in 40 urban wards in April 2016; half of the wards were randomly assigned to the treatment (IPC intervention) with cross-sectional surveys conducted before (n = 2,364) and one year after (n = 2,430) the start of the intervention. A pre-specified intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis measured the impact of randomization to IPC at the community level. In adjusted ITT models, there were no statistically significant differences between intervention and control groups. Due to significant implementation challenges, we also conducted exploratory secondary analyses to estimate effects among those who attended an IPC event (n = 66) using instrumental variable and inverse probability weighting analyses. In addition to increases in FC identification (IPC attendees had higher reported use of any condom, improved perceptions of FC's, and were more likely to have discussed contraceptive use with their partner as compared to non-attendees). The introduction of a new FC product combined with an IPC intervention significantly increased general knowledge and awareness in the community as compared to media alone, but did not lead to detectable community level impacts on other primary outcomes of interest.

Although postpartum family planning (PPFP) is an increasingly high priority for many countries, uptake and need for PPFP varies in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to characterize postpartum contraceptive use, and predictors and barriers to use, among postpartum women in LMIC.\nMETHODS:\nPubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and Global Health databases were searched for articles and abstracts published between January 1997 and May 2018. Studies with data on contraceptive uptake through 12 months postpartum in low- and middle-income countries were included. We used random-effects models to compute pooled estimates and confidence intervals of modern contraceptive prevalence rates (mCPR), fertility intentions (birth spacing and birth limiting), and unmet need for contraception in the postpartum period.\nRESULTS:\nAmong 669 studies identified, 90 were selected for full-text review, and 35 met inclusion criteria. The majority of studies were from East Africa, West Africa, and South Asia/South East Asia. The overall pooled mCPR during the postpartum period across all regions was 41.2% (95% CI: 15.7-69.1%), with lower pooled mCPR in West Africa (36.3%; 95% CI: 27.0-45.5%). The pooled prevalence of unmet need was 48.5% (95% CI: 19.1-78.0%) across all regions, and highest in South Asia/South East Asia (59.4, 95% CI: 53.4-65.4%). Perceptions of low pregnancy risk due to breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhea were commonly associated with lack of contraceptive use and use of male condoms, withdrawal, and abstinence. Women who were not using contraception were also less likely to utilize maternal and child health (MCH) services and reside in urban settings, and be more likely to have a fear of method side effects and receive inadequate FP counseling. In contrast, women who received FP counseling in antenatal and/or postnatal care were more likely to use PPFP.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nPPFP use is low and unmet need for contraception following pregnancy in LMIC is high.

In cervical cancer, p53 is inactivated by degradation through the complex with human papilloma virus (HPV) oncoprotein E6 and E6-associated protein (E6AP), an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase. In endometrial cancer, overexpression of p53 in immunohistochemistry is a significant prognostic factor. A discrepancy between p53 overexpression and TP53 mutations is observed in endometrioid endometrial cancer, indicating that the accumulation of p53 protein can be explained by not only gene mutations but also dysregulation of the factors such as ERβ and MDM2. Furthermore, the double-positive expression of immunoreactive estrogen receptor (ER) β and p53 proteins is closely associated with the incidence of metastasis and/or recurrence. High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) arises from secretary cells in the fallopian tube. The secretary cell outgrowth (SCOUT) with TP53 mutations progresses to HGSC via the p53 signature, serous intraepithelial lesion (STIL), and serous intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC), indicating that TP53 mutation is associated with carcinogenesis of HGSC.

Preliminary clinical data reported Bevacizumab effectiveness in EC both as single agent and in combination with chemotherapy.\nMETHODS:\nIn a phase II trial, patients with advanced (FIGO stage III-IV) or recurrent EC were randomized to receive Carboplatin-Paclitaxel standard dose for 6-8 cycles vs Carboplatin-Paclitaxel and Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg in combination with chemotherapy and maintenance until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).\nRESULTS:\n108 patients were randomized; PFS (10.5 vs 13.7 months, HR 0.84 p = 0.43), overall response rate (ORR 53.1% vs 74.4%) and overall survival (OS) (29.7 vs 40.0 months, HR 0.71 p = 0.24) resulted in a non-significant increase in Bevacizumab treated patients. The PFS increase became significant when an exploratory analysis with the Breslow test was used. Moreover, patients treated with Bevacizumab experienced a significant increase in 6-month disease control rate (70.4% vs 90.7%).

One to two prior cytotoxic regimens were allowed; prior use of a MEK or PI3K pathway inhibitor was excluded. Initial trial design consisted of a KRAS mutation stratified randomized phase II with a safety lead-in evaluating the combination. For the safety lead in, the previously recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D; trametinib 1.5 mg, GSK2141795 50 mg) was chosen for Dose Level 1 (DL1).\nRESULTS:\nOf 26 enrolled patients, 14 were treated on DL1 and 12 were treated on DL-1 (trametinib 1.5 mg, GSK2141795 25 mg). Most common histologies were endometrioid (58%) and serous (27%). Four of 25 (16%) patients were KRAS mutant. Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were assessed during cycle 1. DL1 had 8 DLTs (hypertension (n = 2), mucositis (2), rash (2), dehydration, stroke/acute kidney injury). DL1 was deemed non-tolerable so DL-1 was explored. DL-1 had no DLTs. Sixty-five percent of patients had ≥ grade 3 toxicity. There were no responses in DL1 (0%, 90%CI 0-15%) and 1 response in DL-1 (8.3%, 90%CI 0.4-33.9%).

We investigated the oncologic safety and complication rates of early-stage EC treated with laparotomy (LAP) versus minimally invasive hysterectomy (MIH). A secondary study aim was the evaluation of risk factors for relapse and complications.\nMETHODS:\nData from the Cancer Registry Rostock, Germany, and the medical records of women diagnosed with type 1 EC between January 2005 and December 2014 were retrospectively evaluated. The baseline characteristics were analyzed with the χ2 test and Fisher's exact test. Multivariate analysis with the Cox proportional-hazards model and logistic regression were performed to identify prognostic factors for time to event and risk factors for complications. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed for disease-free and overall survival.\nRESULTS:\nOf 350 evaluated patients, 242 underwent traditional LAP; on 108 patients, MIH was performed. The median follow-up period in the LAP group and the MIH group was 82 ± 31.1 and 71.1 ± 33.6 months, respectively (p = 0.10). The median time to event was 40.3 ± 28.1 months in the LAP group and 38.0 ± 27.5 months in the MIH group (p = 0.476). Significantly longer surgery times (p < 0.001) and more complications (p < 0.001) were observed in the LAP group. Disease-free survival after MIH was not significantly different from that after LAP (log-rank p = 0.052). Multimorbidity remained as the single risk factor for event/recurrence (p = 0.019) in multivariate analysis.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nMIH for early-stage EC may be an oncologically safe approach when compared to LAP, and its complication rates are lower; therefore, MIH represents the preferred approach for this patient cohort.\n© 2019 S.

Based on this assessment, we selected a balanced sample of cows that remained healthy (no signs of illness; n = 20), cows diagnosed with either HYK (n = 20) or metritis (n = 20), and cows with both HYK and metritis (n = 20). Video recordings from the 8 wk before calving (scored every 2 wk for 90 min immediately after fresh feed delivery) were used to evaluate feeding behavior and competition at the feed bunk. Feeding behavior before calving was associated with postpartum diagnosis of HYK and metritis. Specifically, cows that spent less time eating had higher odds of HYK and metritis. Odds of remaining healthy (compared with becoming sick with at least 1 condition) increased by 1.3 times for every additional 15 min spent eating. Additionally, cows that were involved in fewer agonistic interactions prepartum were more likely to be diagnosed with both conditions during the postpartum period. Odds of remaining healthy (compared with becoming sick with at least one condition) increased by 1.9 times for every 6 additional interactions. We conclude that prepartum feeding and agonistic behaviors can be used to identify animals at risk of HYK and metritis postpartum.\nCopyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

Although numerous studies have been performed to find the therapeutic agents for endometritis, the incidence of this disease remains high.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effects and mechanisms of sodium butyrate (SB) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endometritis in mice. The mice were administered by intraperitoneal injection of SB at 1 h before LPS injection. 24 h later, the uterus tissues were collected. Hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) stained sections of uterus were used to determine the degree of the damage. Uterine myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was used to analyze neutrophil granulocytes concentration. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were measured by ELISA. The activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. The results showed that SB significantly attenuated the pathological injury of the uterus tissues. SB also suppressed LPS-induced MPO activity and the production of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β. Furthermore, Western blot analysis showed that SB inhibited the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway. In addition, SB could inhibit histone deacetylases. In summary, SB protects against LPS-induced endometritis through HDAC inhibition.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we treated hESCs with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and found that LPS treatment increased the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, and TNFα, and the secretion of IL-6. SR9009, a Rev-erbα agonist, significantly alleviated the LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in hESCs. Meanwhile, knockdown of Rev-erbα increased the expressions of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8, accompanied by an increased mRNA level of the core clock gene Bmal1. Western blot analysis showed that SR9009 inhibited the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the activation of NF-κB induced by LPS. All these findings suggested that pharmacological activation of Rev-erbα attenuated the LPS-induced inflammatory response of hESCs by suppressing TLR4-regulated NF-κB activation. This study may provide a strategy for preventing inflammation-related endometrial dysfunction and infertility or recurrent implantation failure.\n© The Author(s) 2019.

The incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) has increased due to the sexually active status of the young population. This leads to a more serious problem and a larger effect than previously observed. However, there have been few studies on this topic in Asian populations.\nAIM:\nWe aimed to evaluate the risk of preterm labor and/or ectopic pregnancy in Taiwanese women following PID.\nDESIGN:\nUsing the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database, we designed a retrospective cohort study that included 12- to 55-year-old pregnant women between 2000 and 2010. We selected a 1:3 age-matched control group of non-PID women. The endpoint was any episode of preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy; otherwise, the patients were tracked until 31 December 2010.\nMETHODS:\nThe risk factors for preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy were explored. For cases included from the index date until the end of 2010, we analyzed the risk of incident preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy. With the use of a multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, we calculated the hazard ratio (HR) with a 95% CI and compared it with that of the control group.\nRESULTS:\nThis study examined 30,450 patients with PID and 91,350 controls. During the follow-up period, patients in the PID group were more likely to develop preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy than patients in the control group. The cumulative incidence rates for developing preterm labor were 1.84% (561/30,450 individuals) in patients with PID and 1.63% (1492/91,350 individuals) in patients without PID. On the other hand, the cumulative incidence rate for developing ectopic pregnancy in patients with PID was 0.05% (14/30,450 individuals) but was only 0.04% (33/91,350 individuals) in patients without PID. Compared with those without PID, the patients with PID had a 1.864 times (P<0.001) higher risk of developing preterm labor and a 2.121 times (P = 0.003) higher risk of developing ectopic pregnancy.\nCONCLUSION:\nOur study provided evidence of an increased risk of preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy in PID patients."}, {"authors": ["Voon HY", "Pow JY", "Tan LN", "Suharjono HN", "Teo WS"], "topic": "Pelvic Inflammatory Disease", "title": "Antibiotic prophylaxis in ragged placental membranes: a prospective, multicentre, randomized trial.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6624936/", "publication": "BMC Pregnancy Childbirth. 2019 Jul 11;19(1):240. doi: 10.1186/s12884-019-2373-9.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nRagged placental membranes is a distinct entity from retained placenta and not uncommonly reported in midwifery texts. Although the incidence of postpartum endometritis is merely 1-5% after vaginal births, it remains the most common source of puerperal sepsis, contributing up to 15% of maternal mortality in low income countries. Geographically-remote centres in Malaysia prophylactically administer antibiotics for women with ragged placental membranes after vaginal birth, extrapolating evidence from retained placenta. We sought to clarify the rationale in continuing such practices.\nMETHODS:\nThis was an open-label, prospective, multicentre, randomized trial. Three hospitals where the current protocol was to administer prophylactic amoxycillin-clavulanic acid served as the sites of recruitment. Women who delivered vaginally beyond 24+ 0 weeks of gestation with ragged membranes were invited to participate in the trial and randomized into prophylaxis or expectant management with medical advice by blocks of 10, at a 1:1 ratio. A medication adherence diary was provided and patients followed up at 2 weeks and 6 weeks postpartum.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 6569 women gave birth vaginally in three centres during the trial period, of which 10.9% had ragged membranes. The incidence of endometritis was not significantly raised in women with or without prophylaxis (0.90% vs 0.29%; p = 0.60). All cases of endometritis presented within the first 2 weeks and preventive use of antibiotics did not ameliorate the severity of endometritis since rates of ICU admission, surgical evacuation and transfusion were comparable.\nCONCLUSION:\nPreventive use of antibiotics after vaginal delivery in women with ragged placental membranes did not result in a reduction of endometritis. Educating women on the signs and symptoms of endometritis would suffice. Based on the reported incidence of ragged membranes, a change in practice would result in 1500 less prescriptions of antibiotics per annum in these three centres.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION:\nNCT03459599 (Retrospectively registered on 9 March 2018)."}, {"authors": ["Fouks Y", "Azem F", "Many A", "Cohen Y", "Levin I", "Cohen A"], "topic": "Pelvic Inflammatory Disease", "title": "Fertility outcomes in patients with tubo-ovarian abscesses after an oocyte retrieval: a longitudinal cohort analysis.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-019-05230-9", "publication": "Arch Gynecol Obstet. 2019 Sep;300(3):763-769. doi: 10.1007/s00404-019-05230-9.

A retrospective cohort study of 136 patients admitted to a tertiary hospital in Singapore for TOA between July 2013 and December 2017 was performed.

Twenty rats were divided into two groups: control group (n = 10) and treatment group (n = 10). hUCMSCs were given to mice after exposure to C. trachomatis for 4 weeks. After treatment for 4 weeks, five mice were randomly selected from each of the two groups to sacrifice and we examined the organ morphology and pathology, inflammatory cytokines, proliferation, and apoptosis in fallopian tube (FT).The remaining five mice from each group were caged 2:1 with male mice for another 4 weeks, the numbers of pregnant mice and the mean number of pups in the different groups were enumerated and calculated.\nRESULTS:\nIntravaginal inoculation of hUCMSCs alleviated hydrosalpinx of the oviduct. EdU-labeled hUCMSCs are located at the interstitial site of the fallopian tube. Macrophage (F4/80) infiltration was significantly reduced in the treatment group compared with the control group and expression levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 were increased after hUCMSCs treatment. Furthermore, mRNA and protein expression levels of PCNA and Caspase-3 were increased and decreased, respectively, in the hUCMSCs' treatment group compared with the control.

The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of endometritis (as defined by the presence of any abnormal vaginal discharge after 21 days post-partum) on post-partum ovarian cyclicity in dairy cows. Milk progesterone analysis was used to monitor reproductive cyclicity in 170 dairy cows across three different commercial herds. Associations between the occurrence of endometritis and the incidence risk of a variety of atypical cycle profiles during the calving to conception period were investigated to establish the importance of endometritis on post-partum ovarian activity. Endometritis increased the incidence odds of atypical ovarian profiles (P < 0.05) with prolonged luteal activity being the most affected (P < 0.05), but also showed prolonged time (3 days) to onset of luteal activity after parturition (P < 0.05). Using milk progesterone analysis, we found a relatively low incidence odds for reproductive cycle problems in healthy cows during the calving to conception period. However, the incidence odds of cycle problems, in particular prolonged luteal activity, were high in cows that had experienced endometritis, which would have significantly impaired reproductive function.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The remaining two works were a retrospective observational trial and a retrospective case series respectively. Five studies evaluated the effects of tibolone, also comparing it with various estrogen/progestin combinations, while two were about raloxifene. Thirteen studies compared different combinations of estrogens/progestins, the most common being transdermal estrogens (used in nine studies) and medroxyprogesterone acetate at different doses (used in 10 studies). Conclusions: For women with uterine fibroids, the choice of the most appropriate HRT regimen is crucial to avoid leiomyomas growth and the symptoms possibly related to it. Available data are conflicting, but suggest that uterine fibroids might be influenced by HRT, without representing an absolute contraindication to hormonal replacement therapy. Women with uterine fibroids subjected to HRT should be periodically examined and hormonal treatment should be discontinued if leiomyomas appear to increase in size. Moreover, the minimal effective dose of progestin should be employed."}, {"authors": ["Palma F", "Fontanesi F", "Facchinetti F", "Cagnacci A"], "topic": "Hormone Replacement Therapy", "title": "Acupuncture or phy(F)itoestrogens vs. (E)strogen plus progestin on menopausal symptoms.

Between 2008 and 2014, participants reported any episodes of diverticulitis that required antibiotics and the date of occurrence. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nRESULTS:\nOver 24 years encompassing 1,297,165 person-years of follow-up, we documented 5,425 incident cases of diverticulitis. We observed an increased risk of diverticulitis among both current (HR 1.28; 95% CI 1.18-1.39) and past (HR 1.35; 95% CI 1.25-1.45) MHT users compared to never users.

The risk did not increase with longer duration of use (P-trend = 0.76). The association between MHT and diverticulitis was not modified by age, body mass index, past oral contraceptive use, or fiber intake (all P-interaction >0.11).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nMenopausal hormone therapy was associated with an increased risk of diverticulitis.

An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health and menopause was recruited by NAMS to review the 2012 Position Statement, evaluate new literature, assess the evidence, and reach consensus on recommendations, using the level of evidence to identify the strength of recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees.Hormone therapy (HT) remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture. The risks of HT differ depending on type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is used. Treatment should be individualized to identify the most appropriate HT type, dose, formulation, route of administration, and duration of use, using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation of the benefits and risks of continuing or discontinuing HT.For women aged younger than 60 years or who are within 10 years of menopause onset and have no contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio is most favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and for those at elevated risk for bone loss or fracture. For women who initiate HT more than 10 or 20 years from menopause onset or are aged 60 years or older, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of the greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and dementia. Longer durations of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistent VMS or bone loss, with shared decision making and periodic reevaluation. For bothersome GSM symptoms not relieved with over-the-counter therapies and without indications for use of systemic HT, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy or other therapies are recommended.This NAMS position statement has been endorsed by Academy of Women's Health, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American Association of Nurse Practitioners, American Medical Women's Association, American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Asociación Mexicana para el Estudio del Climaterio, Association of Reproductive Health Professionals, Australasian Menopause Society, Chinese Menopause Society, Colegio Mexicano de Especialistas en Ginecologia y Obstetricia, Czech Menopause and Andropause Society, Dominican Menopause Society, European Menopause and Andropause Society, German Menopause Society, Groupe d'études de la ménopause et du vieillissement Hormonal, HealthyWomen, Indian Menopause Society, International Menopause Society, International Osteoporosis Foundation, International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health, Israeli Menopause Society, Japan Society of Menopause and Women's Health, Korean Society of Menopause, Menopause Research Society of Singapore, National Association of Nurse Practitioners in Women's Health, SOBRAC and FEBRASGO, SIGMA Canadian Menopause Society, Società Italiana della Menopausa, Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, South African Menopause Society, Taiwanese Menopause Society, and the Thai Menopause Society.

The issue is of utmost public health importance because coronary heart disease (CHD) remains the leading cause of death among postmenopausal women. Fortunately, a unifying hypothesis has emerged that reproductive stage is a major determinant of the effect of estrogens on atherosclerosis progression, complications, and plaque vulnerability.\nPREMENOPAUSAL YEARS:\nPremenopausal atherosclerosis progression seems to be an important determinant of postmenopausal atherosclerosis and thus the risk for CHD. Clearly, plasma lipids/lipoproteins influence this progression; however, estradiol deficiency seems to be the major modulator. Both monkeys and women with premenopausal estrogen deficiency develop premature atherosclerosis, an effect that can be prevented in both species by estrogen-containing oral contraceptives.\nPERIMENOPAUSAL/EARLY POSTMENOPAUSAL YEARS:\nDuring this stage, there are robust estrogen benefits. Monkeys given estrogens immediately after surgical menopause have a 70% inhibition in coronary atherosclerosis progression. Estrogen treatment prevented progression of atherosclerosis of women in the Estrogen in the Prevention of Atherosclerosis Trial. A meta-analysis of women younger than 60 years given hormone therapy had reduced total mortality (relative risk = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.39-0.95).\nLATE POSTMENOPAUSAL YEARS:\nThis stage is one in which there are no or possible deleterious estrogen effects. Monkeys lose CHD benefits of estrogens when treatment is delayed. The increase in CHD events associated with initiating hormone therapy 10 or more years after menopause seems to be related to up-regulation of the plaque inflammatory processes and plaque instability and may be down-regulated by statin pretreatment."}, {"authors": ["Ettinger B", "Li DK", "Klein R"], "topic": "Hormone Replacement Therapy", "title": "Continuation of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy: comparison of cyclic versus continuous combined schedules.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1097/GME.0000000000001215", "publication": "Menopause. 2018 Nov;25(11):1187-1190. doi: 10.1097/GME.0000000000001215.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nDiscontinuation of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is much more common than what is reported in randomized, double-blind clinical trials.

We hypothesized CEE alone induces estrogen hydroxylation along the 2-pathway rather than the competing 16-pathway, a pattern linked to reduced postmenopausal breast cancer risk. One thousand eight hundred and sixty-four women in a WHIOS case-control study of estrogen metabolism and ovarian and endometrial cancer were studied of whom 609 were current E + P users (351 used CEE + MPA), while 272 used E alone (162 used CEE). Fifteen EM were measured, and analyses were conducted for each metabolite, hydroxylation pathway (2-, 4-, or 16-pathway) and ratios of pathway concentrations using inverse probability weighted linear regression. Compared to E + P users, all EM were higher in E alone users (significant for unconjugated estrone, total/conjugated estradiol, total/unconjugated 2-methoxyestrone, 4-methoxyestrone and unconjugated estriol). The relative concentrations of 2- and 4-pathway EM did not differ between the MHT users (2-pathway EM comprised 15% and 4-pathway EM <2% of the total), but 16-pathway EM were lower in E alone users (p = 0.036). Ratios of 2- and 4-pathway EM compared to 16-pathway EM were significantly higher in E alone compared to E + P users. Similar but not significant patterns were observed in CEE-alone and CEE + MPA users. Our data suggest that compared to E + P users, women using E alone have more extensive metabolism via the 2- vs. the competing 16-pathway.

We compared the former use of estradiol-progestogen postmenopausal hormone therapy in nonhysterectomized women with a uterine prolapse surgery (N = 12,072) and control women (N = 33,704).\nMETHODS:\nThe women with a history of uterine prolapse operation were identified from the Finnish National Hospital Discharge Register, and the control women from the Finnish Central Population Register. The use of hormone therapy was traced from the national drug reimbursement register, and the odd ratios with 95% CIs for prolapse were calculated by using the conditional logistic regression analysis.\nRESULTS:\nThe women with uterine prolapse had used hormone therapy more often than control women (N = 4,127; 34.2% vs N = 9,189; 27.3%; P < 0.005). The use of hormone therapy was accompanied by significant (23%-53%) elevations in the risk for prolapse, being higher with longer exposure.

In some animal models, progesterone affects cognitive performance, and its potential role in human cognition is especially germane to women.

In naturally cycling reproductive-age women and pregnant women, there is no consistent relation between progesterone levels and cognition. In postmenopausal women within 6 years of menopause and not using hormone therapy, progesterone levels are positively associated with verbal memory and global cognition, but reported associations in older postmenopausal women are null. Some observational studies of postmenopausal women using hormone therapy raise concern of a small deleterious cognitive effect of progestogen (medroxyprogesterone acetate was most often reported in these studies), but this association may due to confounding factors.

Costs and effects were analysed with this model for four different cost scenarios: high-, higher medium, lower medium and low-cost. Base case, sensitivity, threshold, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to examine the cost-effectiveness implications of PGT-A.\nRESULTS:\nPGT-A increased the cost per live birth by approximately 15% in the high-cost scenario to approximately 285% in the low-cost scenario. Threshold analysis revealed that PGT-A would need to be associated with an absolute increase in pregnancy rate by 6% to >39% or, alternatively, would need to be US$2,969 (high-cost scenario) to US$4,888 (low-cost scenario) cheaper.

Several risk factors have been associated with an increased risk of stillbirth: including maternal medical factors, maternal characteristics, fetal factors, sociodemographic factors and behavioral factors. The aim of this work is to review the literature on risk factors that have a behavioral component. The main behaviors modulating the risk of stillbirth that have been more widely studied in the literature include use of substances (smoking, alcohol, illicit drugs and medical drugs), weight management, attendance at antenatal care and sleeping position. There is evidence in the literature that supports that all those behaviors have an impact on the risk of stillbirth, especially in the cases of smoking and drugs consumption during the pregnancy.

Basic neonatal resuscitation can reduce intrapartum stillbirth and early neonatal mortality, if delivered in a high-quality health system, but there is a dearth of evidence on how to scale up such evidence-based interventions. We evaluated the scaling up of a quality improvement (QI) package for neonatal resuscitation on intrapartum-related mortality (intrapartum stillbirth and first day mortality) at hospitals in Nepal.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS:\nWe conducted a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial in 12 hospitals over a period of 18 months from April 14, 2017, to October 17, 2018. The hospitals were assigned to one of four wedges through random allocation. The QI package was implemented in a stepped-wedge manner with a delay of three months for each step. The QI package included improving hospital leadership on intrapartum care, building health workers' competency on neonatal resuscitation, and continuous facilitated QI processes in clinical units. An independent data collection system was set up at each hospital to gather data on mortality through patient case note review and demographic characteristics of women using semi-structured exit interviews. The generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) and multivariate logistic regression were used for analyses. During this study period, a total of 89,014 women-infant pairs were enrolled. The mean age of the mother in the study period was 24.0 ± 4.3 years, with 54.9% from disadvantaged ethnic groups and 4.0% of them illiterate. Of the total birth cohort, 54.4% were boys, 16.7% had gestational age less than 37 weeks, and 17.1% had birth weight less than 2,500 grams. The incidence of intrapartum-related mortality was 11.0 per 1,000 births during the control period and 8.0 per 1,000 births during the intervention period (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69-0.92; p = 0.002; intra-cluster correlation coefficient [ICC], 0.0286). The incidence of early neonatal mortality was 12.7 per 1,000 live births during the control period and 10.1 per 1,000 live births during the intervention period (aOR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.78-1.02; p = 0.09; ICC, 0.1538). The use of bag-and-mask ventilation for babies with low Apgar score (<7 at 1 minute) increased from 3.2% in the control period to 4.0% in the intervention period (aOR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.32-1.77, p = 0.003). There were two major limitations to the study; although a large sample of women-infant pairs were enrolled in the study, the clustering reduced the power of the study. Secondly, the study was not sufficiently powered to detect reduction in early neonatal mortality with the number of clusters provided.\nCONCLUSION:\nThese results suggest scaled-up implementation of a QI package for neonatal resuscitation can reduce intrapartum-related mortality and improve clinical care. The QI intervention package is likely to be effective in similar settings.

From the psychological perspective pregnancy loss and perinatal death are amongst the most stressful events in human life - carrying increased risk of developing affective, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorders. Psychologists, physicians and the rest of the medical staff should provide integrated and individualized care which should be based on respect, empathy and expertise. The necessary phases of support for women experiencing pregnancy loss are: (1) physician providing exhaustive informational support regarding state of health, potential causes of fetal death, further approach and phases of induced labor of the fetus/pregnancy termination/procedure, (2) facilitating psychological consultation at any time and (3) providing exhaustive information on current legal standing (health insurance and labor law).

Epub 2019 Jul 9.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nRIF is clinically defined as the failure of good quality embryos to implant into the uterus following at least three cycles of In Vitro Fertilization/Embryo Transfer (IVF/ET). During human pregnancy, a genetically different fetus is allowed to survive within the uterus despite the maternal recognition of fetal alloantigens. Compared with normal pregnant women, early loss of embryo is associated with systemic lower levels of Treg cells in IVF. Moreover, several lines of evidence have indicated that differentiation of naive T cells into Th17 is deleterious for normal pregnancy and may cause implantation failure. Sirolimus as the most common mTOR (mammalian target of Rapamycin) inhibitor is able to effectively prevent allograft rejection. Here we aimed to evaluate Sirolimus effects on Th17/Treg axis and subsequently on pregnancy outcome.\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS:\n121 patients with a history of at least 3 implatation failures were selected and enrolled in this clinical trial. Blood was drawn between days 5 and 10 of the cycle prior to the index IVF/ET cycle to assess baseline value of Th17 cells and regulatory T cells ratios using flowcytometry. A Th17/Treg cell ratio equal or >0.74 was considered to be the elevated Th17/Treg cell ratio. In 76 patients with elevated Th17/Treg ratios, 43 individuals were treated with Sirolimus and 33 remained untreated.\nRESULTS:\nOur results demonstrated that Sirolimus treatment led to an increase in Treg cells number and function in treated group and reduced the frequency and function of Th17 cells. Moreover Th17/Treg cell ratio, significantly reduced from 1.18 ± 0.46% to 0.9 ± 0.45% following Sirolimus intervention (P = 0.024). In contrast, no significant difference in Th17 and Treg cell frequencies and Th17/Treg cell ratio was observed in untreated control subjects before and after ET. Finally our data showed a significantly higher clinical pregnancy rate (55.81%) in Sirolimus-treated patients compared with control group (24.24%) (P < 0.0005). We also found a significantly increased live birth rate (48.83%) in RIF women who received Sirolimus compared with control group (21.21%) (P < 0.0001).\nCONCLUSION:\nThe findings of the current study revealed the fact that Sirolimus exhibit potent immunosuppressive effects by blocking intracellular immune responses downstream of co-stimulatory signals, also is able to improve reproductive outcome in RIF women with imbalanced Th17/Treg ratio by modulate of Th17 /Treg axis, thus representing a new approach for the potential treatment of patients with embryo implantation failure.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Assessed outcomes included qPCR viral load profile during treatment, number of antiviral intravitreal injections (IVT), retinal detachment rate, and best-corrected visual acuity.\nRESULTS:\nFinal visual acuity was 20/200 or less in 20% of cases; the rate of retinal detachment was 16%. Viral load kinetics changed in 3 phases: a first plateau period that was not consistent, a logarithmic decrease phase, and a negativation phase. Mean decay of the logarithm of the viral load was estimated at 0.076 per day; mean time of negativation was 56.1 days. Median IVT number was 9 (range, 0-28). Ten patients were treated with injections until the viral load was undetectable. Resistance to acyclovir was observed in a patient with a prolonged initial plateau of the viral load.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nNumerous and prolonged IVTs, used as adjunctive therapy, could improve the prognosis of treated patients by decreasing the risk of retinal detachment and improving visual acuity. QPCR enables monitoring of the response to treatment and can provide evidence for resistance to antiviral treatment by enabling the detection of cases with a prolonged initial plateau of viral load.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, incidence is low and acyclovir, the treatment of choice, carries risk of toxicity. We aimed to increase the percentage of patients 0 to 60 days of age who are tested and treated for HSV in accordance with local guideline recommendations from 40% to 80%.\nMETHODS:\nThis quality improvement project took place at 1 freestanding children's hospital. Multiple plan-do-study-act cycles were focused on interventions aimed at key drivers including provider buy-in, guideline availability, and accurate identification of high-risk patients. A run chart was used to track the effect of interventions on the percentage managed per guideline recommendations over time by using established rules for determining special cause. Pre- and postimplementation acyclovir use was compared by using a χ2 test. In HSV-positive cases, delayed acyclovir initiation, defined as >1 day from presentation, was tracked as a balancing measure.\nRESULTS:\nThe median percentage of patients managed according to guideline recommendations increased from 40% to 80% within 8 months. Acyclovir use decreased from 26% to 7.9% (P < .001) in non-high-risk patients but did not change significantly in high-risk patients (73%-83%; P = .15).

Based on the wrist-ankle acupuncture (WAA) theory, we designed a portable WAA point compression treatment strap that treats diseases by automatically applying pressure to acupuncture points. The proposed study aims to evaluate the immediate analgesic effect of the acupressure wrist-ankle strap in patients with primary dysmenorrhea.\nMETHODS:\nThe study will be a randomized controlled trial conducted from May 1, 2019 to May 30, 2020 that includes 78 students from Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine who have primary dysmenorrhea and meet the eligibility criteria. Participants will be randomly divided into 2 groups in a 1:1 allocation ratio. The intervention group will use the acupressure wrist-ankle strap equipped with tip compression component parts on the internal side; the control group will use the nonacupressure wrist-ankle strap with the tip compression parts removed. All participants will be treated for 30 minutes on the 1st day of menstruation. The primary outcome is the pain intensity score measured by the visual analog scale. The secondary outcomes are the onset time of analgesia, the pain threshold at Yinlingquan (SP 9), skin temperature at Guanyuan (CV 4), and expectations and satisfaction of patients as investigated via the expectation and treatment credibility scale.\nDISCUSSION:\nThis trial will be the 1st study to evaluate the analgesic effect of the acupressure wrist-ankle strap in patients with primary dysmenorrhea.

This randomized controlled parallel trial is designed to evaluate the immediate analgesic effect and hemodynamic responses in uterine arterial blood flow of perpendicular needling and transverse needling at SP6 in patients with PD of cold-dampness stagnation pattern using color doppler ultrasonography.\nMETHODS:\nForty-eight patients who meet inclusion criteria will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to either perpendicular needling or transverse needling groups. Every participant will receive 1 session of acupuncture treatment for 10 minutes at bilateral SP6. In the perpendicular needling group, needles will be inserted vertically 1 to 1.2 cun and will be manipulated to achieve needling sensation. In transverse needling group, the needles will be inserted transversely 1 to 1.2 cun toward the abdomen without any manipulation to avoid needling sensation. Color doppler ultrasonography will be performed before, during, and after needling. The primary outcome measure is visual analog scale for pain. The secondary outcome measures include the uterine artery blood flow changes by measuring pulsatility index, resistance index values, and ratio of systolic peak and diastolic peak, the Hamilton anxiety scale, blood pressure, and heart rate.

The evaluation of the methodological quality of the studies was carried out by PEDro scale.\nDATA SYNTHESIS:\nThere was moderate evidence that therapeutic exercise can be considered a useful tool in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea in terms of a reduction in pain intensity. Regarding the duration of pain and quality of life, there was low evidence and very low evidence, respectively. In the 3 meta-analyses, the results were significantly positive in favor of exercise for decreases in both the intensity and the duration of pain.\nLIMITATIONS:\nLimitations of this study include the great heterogeneity of the interventions applied in the studies in terms of type of exercise, in combination or alone, and dosage. This review includes a small number of studies with risk of bias, so the present findings must be interpreted with caution.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nTherapeutic exercise reduces pain intensity in patients with primary dysmenorrhea.\n© 2019 American Physical Therapy Association."}, {"authors": ["Xu L", "Xie T", "Shen T", "Zhang T"], "topic": "Period Pain", "title": "Effect of Chinese herbal medicine on primary dysmenorrhea: A protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6756727/", "publication": "Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Sep;98(38):e17191. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000017191.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nPrimary dysmenorrhea (PD), the most common gynecological diseases, seriously affects women's life and work; however, without more effective treatment.

Women often seek online information on dysmenorrhoea; however, little is known about the information quality.\nDESIGN:\nThis was a descriptive study to evaluate online information on dysmenorrhoea.\nMETHODS:\nWe imitated search strategies of the general public. Specifically, we employed the three most popular search engines worldwide-Google, Yahoo and Bing-and used lay search terms, \"period pain\" and \"menstrual cramps.\" We screened 60 web pages. Following removal of duplicates and irrelevant web pages, 25 met the eligibility criteria. Two team members independently evaluated the included web pages using standardised tools. Readability was evaluated with the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease and Flesch-Kincaid Grade formulas; credibility, quality and usability were evaluated with established tools. We followed the STROBE checklist for reporting this study.\nRESULTS:\nFor readability, the mean Flesch-Kincaid level was 10th grade. For credibility, 8% of web pages referenced scientific literature and 28% stated the author's name and qualifications. For quality, no web page employed user-driven content production; 8% of web pages referenced evidence-based guidelines, 32% of web pages had accurate content, and 4% of web pages recommended shared decision-making.

From studies in patients with endometriosis and premenstrual disorder, it has been shown that these symptoms can have a large impact on women's quality of life and account for substantial health care use. Furthermore, it is estimated that many women initially do not consult a doctor while facing menstrual symptoms. Consequently, the impact of menstrual symptoms on daily activities in the general population is unknown.\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo obtain a nationwide overview of menstrual symptoms and their impact on everyday activities.\nSTUDY DESIGN:\nNationwide, cross-sectional, internet-based survey among 42,879 women aged 15-45 years, conducted from July to October 2017.\nOUTCOME MEASURES:\npresence of menstrual symptoms, pain or intensity score, impact on daily activities.\nRESULTS:\nDysmenorrhea was the most common symptom, with a prevalence of 85%, followed by psychological complaints (77%), and tiredness (71%). During their menstrual period, 38% of all women reported not to be able to perform all their regular daily activities. From the women that had to skip tasks because of their symptoms, only 48.6% told their family that menstrual symptoms were the reason for the transfer of tasks.\nCONCLUSION:\nMenstrual symptoms are widespread among the general population. One in 3 women quit daily activities owing to menstrual symptoms. Half of all women did not mention menstrual complaints being the reason for transferring tasks in a family setting. These results must be interpreted with caution owing to the potential for selection bias. However, considering the impact of menstrual symptoms on daily activities in a large group of women, it is time to open the societal dialogue and improve education for both patients and doctors.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

VAS score after the 3rd month of treatment in the XZD plus WM group was also lower than that in the WM group (mean difference -0.45, 95% confidence interval [-0.79, -0.12], P < .01). In 4 XZD versus WM design studies, XZD sole therapy showed better response rate than did WM sole therapy (relative risk 1.26, 95% confidence interval [1.06, 1.49], P < .01).\nCONCLUSION:\nThe existing trials showed a favorable effect of XZD for the management of primary dysmenorrhea. However, the efficacy of XZD on primary dysmenorrhea is not conclusive owing to the small number of studies and the high risk of bias. Large-scale, long-term RCTs with rigorous methodological input are needed to clarify the role of XZD for the management of primary dysmenorrhea.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:\nCRD42016050447 in PROSPERO 2016."}, {"authors": ["Dias SFL", "Pereira LCA", "Oliveira AP", "Santos RFD", "Nunes LCC"], "topic": "Period Pain", "title": "Scientific and technological prospection on transdermal formulations and complementary therapies for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/13543776.2019.1562547", "publication": "Expert Opin Ther Pat. 2019 Feb;29(2):115-126. doi: 10.1080/13543776.2019.1562547.

Epub 2018 May 5.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nDysmenorrhea is a pervasive pain condition that affects 20-50% of reproductive-aged women. Distension of a visceral organ, such as the uterus, could elicit a visceromotor reflex, resulting in involuntary skeletal muscle activity and referred pain. Although referred abdominal pain mechanisms can contribute to visceral pain, the role of abdominal muscle activity has not yet been investigated within the context of menstrual pain.\nOBJECTIVE:\nThe goal of this study was to determine whether involuntary abdominal muscle activity precedes spontaneous episodes of menstrual cramping pain in dysmenorrheic women and whether naproxen administration affects abdominal muscle activity.\nSTUDY DESIGN:\nAbdominal electromyography activity was recorded from women with severe dysmenorrhea (n = 38) and healthy controls (n = 10) during menses. Simultaneously, pain was measured in real time using a squeeze bulb or visual analog rheostat. Ninety minutes after naproxen administration, abdominal electromyography activity and menstrual pain were reassessed. As an additional control, women were also recorded off menses, and data were analyzed in relation to random bulb squeezes. Because it is unknown whether mechanisms of menstrual cramps are different in primary or secondary dysmenorrhea/chronic pelvic pain, the relationship between medical history and abdominal muscle activity was examined. To further examine differences in nociceptive mechanisms, pressure pain thresholds were also measured to evaluate changes in widespread pain sensitivity.\nRESULTS:\nAbdominal muscle activity related to random-bulb squeezing was rarely observed in healthy controls on menses (0.9 ± 0.6 episodes/hour) and in dysmenorrhea participants off menses (2.3 ± 0.6 episodes/hour). In dysmenorrheic participants during menses, abdominal muscle activity frequently preceded bulb squeezing indicative of menstrual cramping pain (10.8 ± 3.0 episodes/hour; P < .004). Whereas 45% of the women with dysmenorrhea (17 of 38) had episodes of abdominal muscle activity associated pain, only 13% (5 of 38) had episodes after naproxen (P = .011). Women with the abdominal muscle activity-associated pain were less likely to have a diagnosis for secondary dysmenorrhea or chronic pelvic pain (2 of 17) than women without this pain phenotype (10 of 21; P = .034). Similarly, women with the abdominal muscle activity-associated pain phenotype had less nonmenstrual pain days per month (0.6 ± 0.5) than women without the phenotype (12.4 ± 0.3; P = .002). Women with abdominal muscle activity-associated pain had pressure pain thresholds (22.4 ± 3.0 N) comparable with healthy controls (22.2 ± 3.0 N; P = .967). In contrast, women without abdominal muscle activity-associated pain had lower pressure pain thresholds (16.1 ± 1.9 N; P = .039).\nCONCLUSION:\nAbdominal muscle activity may contribute to cramping pain in primary dysmenorrhea but is resolvable with naproxen. Dysmenorrheic patients without cramp-associated abdominal muscle activity exhibit widespread pain sensitivity (lower pressure pain thresholds) and are more likely to also have a chronic pain diagnosis, suggesting their cramps are linked to changes in central pain processes. This preliminary study suggests new tools to phenotype menstrual pain and supports the hypothesis that multiple distinct mechanisms may contribute to dysmenorrhea.\nCopyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We used Mahalanobis and exact matched sampling within propensity score calipers to compare 381 youth suspended for the first time in a 1-year period with 980 non-suspended youth. The suspended and non-suspended youth were similar on 67 pre-suspension variables. We evaluated STI outcomes 5 years after suspension.\nRESULTS:\nBefore matching, suspended youth were more likely to test positive for trichomoniasis and gonorrhea, but not chlamydia, than non-suspended youth. Suspended youth were more likely to test positive for trichomoniasis 5 years after suspension than matched non-suspended youth (OR = 2.87 (1.40, 5.99)). Below-median household income before suspension explained 9% of the suspension-trichomoniasis association (p = 0.02), but criminal justice involvement and educational attainment were not statistically significantly mediators.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nSchool suspension is a marker for STI risk. Punishing adolescents for initial deviance may cause them to associate with riskier sexual networks even if they graduate high school and avoid criminal justice system involvement.

Data about sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle-related behaviors, routine hygienic practices, menstrual care and history and type of contraceptive intake were collected using a structured questionnaire. Vaginal discharge samples were collected and examined for discharge characteristics and pH by a gynecologist. Then, samples were examined for BV, VVC and TV.

This pathogen secretes extracellular vesicles (EVs) that mediate its interaction with host cells.

We show that T. vaginalis EVs interact with glycosaminoglycans on the surface of host cells and specifically bind to heparan sulfate (HS) present on host cell surface proteoglycans. Moreover, competition assays using HS or removal of HS from the host cell surface strongly inhibit EV uptake, directly demonstrating that HS proteoglycans facilitate EV internalization. We identified an abundant protein on the surface of T. vaginalis EVs, 4-α-glucanotransferase (Tv4AGT), and show using isothermal titration calorimetry that this protein binds HS. Tv4AGT also competitively inhibits EV uptake, defining it as an EV ligand critical for EV internalization. Finally, we demonstrate that T. vaginalis EV uptake is dependent on host cell cholesterol and caveolin-1 and that internalization proceeds via clathrin-independent, lipid raft-mediated endocytosis.

However, many women leave without a clear diagnosis or experience recurrent symptoms despite treatment. The 3 most common etiologies of vaginitis are trichomonas, bacterial vaginosis, and vulvovaginal candidiasis, which account for an estimated 70% of cases. The remaining 30% may be related to other causes of vaginitis, including atrophic vaginitis, desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, and vaginal erosive disease. The purpose of this review is to describe the noncandidal causes of acute and recurrent vaginitis, with the goal of improving the likelihood of accurate diagnosis as well as efficient and effective therapy. We excluded candidal vaginitis from our review because there was a recently published review on this topic in the Journal. The clinical presentation and evaluation of patients with symptoms of vaginitis can be triaged into 1 of 2 diagnostic pathways: noninflammatory and inflammatory vaginitis. The most common noninflammatory cause is bacterial vaginosis. Features such as irritation, purulent discharge, and the presence of polymorphonuclear neutrophils are more suggestive of an inflammatory process. Trichomoniasis is the most common cause of inflammatory vaginitis. Other well-described forms of inflammatory vaginitis include atrophic vaginitis, desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, and erosive disease. We present a review of the pathogenesis, symptoms, examination findings, diagnostic testing, and treatment for each of these causes of noncandidal vaginitis.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

They were also screened, and treated if applicable, for other urogenital infections. The vaginal microbiota was assessed by Gram stain Nugent scoring, Illumina 16S rRNA HiSeq sequencing (relative abundances), and BactQuant 16S gene quantitative polymerase chain reaction (estimated concentrations). Only women with a pretreatment Nugent score of 7-10 and a valid posttreatment Nugent score (N=55) were included in metronidazole treatment failure analyses, with treatment failure defined as a posttreatment Nugent score of 4-10.\nRESULTS:\nThe bacterial vaginosis cure rate by Nugent scoring was 54.5%. The mean total vaginal bacterial concentration declined from 6.59 to 5.85 log10/μL (P<.001), which was mostly due to a reduction in mean bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobes concentration (all bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobe taxa combined) from 6.23 to 4.55 log10/μL (P<.001). However, only 16.4% of women had a bacterial vaginosis anaerobes concentration reduction of more than 50%, and only 3 women had complete eradication. The mean concentration of lactobacilli (all species combined) increased from 4.98 to 5.56 log10/μL (P=.017), with L. iners being the most common species pre- and posttreatment. The mean concentration of pathobionts (defined as Proteobacteria, streptococci, staphylococci, enterococci, and a few others) did not change significantly: from 1.92 log10/μL pretreatment to 2.01 log10/μL posttreatment (P=.939). Pretreatment pathobionts concentration, and having a pretreatment vaginal microbiota type containing more than 50% Gardnerella vaginalis (compared with less than 50%), were associated with increased likelihood of treatment failure, but the latter did not reach statistical significance (P=.044 and P=.084, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nMetronidazole alone may not cure women with high G. vaginalis relative abundance, potentially due to biofilm presence, and women with high pathobionts concentration.

However, few studies have investigated the extent to which it involves the prostate in the current antimicrobial era. We addressed this question by investigating the relation between T. vaginalis antibody serostatus and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration, a marker of prostate infection, inflammation, and/or cell damage, in young, male, US military members.\nMETHODS:\nWe measured T. vaginalis serum IgG antibodies and serum total PSA concentration in a random sample of 732 young, male US active duty military members. Associations between T. vaginalis serostatus and PSA were investigated by linear regression.\nRESULTS:\nOf the 732 participants, 341 (46.6%) had a low T. vaginalis seropositive score and 198 (27.0%) had a high score, with the remainder seronegative. No significant differences were observed in the distribution of PSA by T. vaginalis serostatus. However, slightly greater, nonsignificant differences were observed when men with high T. vaginalis seropositive scores were compared with seronegative men, and when higher PSA concentrations were examined (≥0.70 ng/mL). Specifically, 42.5% of men with high seropositive scores had a PSA concentration greater than or equal to 0.70 ng/mL compared with 33.2% of seronegative men (adjusted P = .125).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nOverall, our findings do not provide strong support for prostate involvement during T. vaginalis infection, although our suggestive positive findings for higher PSA concentrations do not rule out this possibility entirely. These suggestive findings may be relevant for prostate condition development because higher early- to mid-life PSA concentrations have been found to predict greater prostate cancer risk later in life.\n© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, {"authors": ["Joseph Davey DL", "Nyemba DC", "Gomba Y", "Bekker LG", "Taleghani S", "DiTullio DJ", "Shabsovich D", "Gorbach PM", "Coates TJ", "Klausner JD", "Myer L"], "topic": "Trichomoniasis", "title": "Prevalence and correlates of sexually transmitted infections in pregnancy in HIV-infected and- uninfected women in Cape Town, South Africa.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6602171/", "publication": "PLoS One. 2019 Jul 1;14(7):e0218349. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0218349. eCollection 2019.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nOBJECTIVES:\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs) are associated with adverse outcomes in pregnancy, including mother-to-child HIV transmission.

Incidence and mortality of cervical cancer are unequally distributed among socioeconomic groups, warranting research into how individual socioeconomic factors contribute to this unbalanced uptake of prevention strategies.\nDESIGN:\nSystematic review and narrative synthesis.\nMETHODS:\nThe PRISMA guidelines (PLoS Medicine, 6, 2009, e1000097) guided the selection of papers. MEDLINE, CINHAL, PsychINFO, Science Citation Index and HMIC were searched. Ten articles were suitable. Key findings were then extracted, and a narrative synthesis was completed, using suitable guidance and the AXIS tool.\nRESULTS:\nObtaining high school or college education is associated with uptake of both cervical screening and HPV vaccination. Total household income and income in respect of the countries' poverty line was measured less frequently than education, but associated with screening and vaccination in some studies. Occupation was infrequently measured in comparison to education and income, limiting conclusions of its association to uptake.\nCONCLUSION:\nEducation and income have an association with uptake of cervical screening and HPV vaccination among women. However, evidence is insufficient to affirm a relationship between occupation and uptake of screening and vaccination. Further research would be advised to strengthen these findings.\nRELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE:\nInterventions to promote cervical cancer prevention strategies should be targeted at women and girls with lower education levels and lower income. However, differences are displayed in the relationships between the individual socioeconomic factors and uptake of preventative strategies between countries and populations and so they should be considered separately. Nurses play a considerable role in people's perceptions and experiences of cervical screening and HPV vaccination.

The challenges in introducing quality cytology screening in LMICs led to the evaluation of alternative screening approaches such as visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing-based screening. Large-scale clinical trials have generated sufficient evidence of efficacy of HPV-based screening for the introduction as the primary technology in cervical cancer screening. Being more objective, automated with better sensitivity than cytology requiring fewer rounds of screening and opportunity for self-sampling, HPV testing is thus poised to be more cost-effective in providing opportunity for wider coverage, making it ideal for incorporating into primary screening programs of LMIC settings that could help reduce regional disparities.

We analysed normal tissues, samples with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs). We correlated the presence of HHV-6 and HHV-7 with the finding of human papillomavirus (HPV) in mucosal samples.\nMETHODS:\nCervical samples were examined and grouped as follows: group 1 (n=29), normal cytology; group 2 (n=61), samples with LSIL; group 3 (n=35), samples with HSIL. Molecular biology examinations were performed in all samples to detect HHV-6, HHV-7 and HPV DNA and to typify HHV-6 species.\nRESULTS:\nGroup 1: normal cytology and HPV (-): HHV-6: 6.8% (2/29), HHV-7: 79.3% (23/29); group 2: LSIL and HPV (-): HHV-6: 93.1% (27/29), HHV-7: 96.5% (28/29); LSIL and HPV (+): HHV-6: 0% (0/32), HHV-7: 90.6% (29/32); group 3: HSIL and HPV (-): HHV-6: 20% (2/10), HHV-7: 70% (7/10); HSIL HPV (+): HHV-6: 12% (3/25), HHV-7: 68% (17/25). HHV-6A DNA was not detected in any samples.\nCONCLUSIONS:\n(1) Both HHV-6 and HHV-7 infect the mucosal cells of the cervix with higher prevalence of HHV-7. (2) The higher prevalence of HHV-6 in LSIL HPV (-) samples compared with those with normal cytology indicates that it constitutes a possible risk factor for atypia production. (3) The presence of HHV-7 in all samples questions its role in the production of atypia. (4) The finding of HHV-6 and HHV-7 suggests that the cervical mucosa is a possible transmission pathway for these viruses.\n© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. No commercial re-use.

CytoProcessor (DATEXIM, Caen, France) is a new automated system, designed to integrate seamlessly into the laboratory's existing workflow. We previously demonstrated the superior performance of CytoProcessor for diagnosis of ThinPrep slides compared to the ThinPrep Imaging System (HOLOGIC, Marlborough, MA). Next, we analyzed whether CytoProcessor technology can be adapted for use on Novaprep slides.\nMETHODS:\nUsing artificial intelligence, we developed a new algorithm in CytoProcessor for the analysis of slides prepared using the NOVAPREP Processor System NPS50 (Novacyt, Vélizy-Villacoublay, France). A representative population of 309 cases was selected from the routine workflow in a public hospital. We compared the diagnoses made using CytoProcessor or conventional screening with a microscope. All discordances were resolved by a consensus committee.\nRESULTS:\nThe performance of CytoProcessor in terms of diagnostic accuracy on Novaprep slides was very similar to that observed previously on ThinPrep slides. Compared to conventional screening, CytoProcessor slightly improves diagnostic sensitivity while maintaining a statistically equivalent specificity. Diagnosis was reached 1.6 times faster with CytoProcessor compared to using a microscope.\nCONCLUSION:\nCytoProcessor is a robust automated cervical cytology screening system that can be used successfully with samples having very different characteristics. As previously shown, CytoProcessor confers significant gains in processing time and diagnostic precision. CytoProcessor is accessible through a secured internet connection, making remote diagnosis of Papanicolaou tests possible.\n© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, {"authors": ["Kilic A", "Tastan S", "Guvenc G", "Akyuz A"], "topic": "Cervical Cancer Screening", "title": "Breast and cervical cancer screening for women with physical disabilities: A qualitative study of experiences and barriers.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.14048", "publication": "J Adv Nurs. 2019 Sep;75(9):1976-1986. doi: 10.1111/jan.14048.

However, his landmark research on the development of cervical cytology for the detection of precancerous lesions of the cervix (\"New Cancer Diagnosis,\" 1928) made a rather inauspicious debut in an unlikely venue: John Harvey Kellogg's Third Race Betterment Conference-a meeting devoted to the furtherance of the concept and implementation of eugenics. Herein, we discuss the stark juxtaposition of Papanicolaou's landmark discovery amid the pseudoscience of the third Race Betterment Conference. We discuss the latency of Papnicolaou's discovery-its potential implications unrealized-until co-publication with Herbert Traut, which catapulted Papanicolaou's research to the scientific foreground. This gave rise to public health initiatives aimed at establishing the Pap smear as a screening tool. We further delineate the progress made in recent decades with the identification of HPV as the etiological agent for cervical cancer, and the subsequent development of the HPV vaccine, and discuss ongoing research in the present day. In this way, we hope to provide a background and historical context for the development of the Pap smear.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Little is known of the genetic basis of diminished ovarian reserve, while premature ovarian insufficiency often has a genetic basis, with genes affecting various processes. NR5A1 is a key gene required for gonadal function, and variants are associated with a wide phenotypic spectrum of disorders of sexual development, and are found in 0.26-8% of patients with premature ovarian insufficiency. As there is some debate about the extent of involvement of NR5A1 in the pathogenesis of ovarian deficiency, we performed an in-depth analysis of NR5A1 variants detected in a cohort of 142 patients with premature ovarian insufficiency, diminished ovarian reserve, or unexplained infertility associated with normal ovarian function. We identified rare non-synonymous protein-altering variants in 2.8 % of women with ovarian deficiency and no such variants in our small cohort of women with infertility but normal ovarian function. We observed previously reported variants associated with premature ovarian insufficiency in patients with diminished ovarian reserve, highlighting a genetic relationship between these conditions. We confirmed functional impairment resulting from a p.Val15Met variant, detected for the first time in a patient with premature ovarian insufficiency. The remaining variants were associated with preserved transcriptional activity and localization of NR5A1, indicating that rare NR5A1 variants may be incorrectly curated if functional studies are not undertaken, and/or that NR5A1 variants may have only a subtle impact on protein function and/or confer risk of ovarian deficiency via oligogenic inheritance.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Females with Turner syndrome are characterized by skeletal abnormalities, short stature and primary ovarian insufficiency. The aim of this narrative review was to identify the underlying mechanisms of osteoporosis in Turner syndrome, summarize its clinical manifestations and provide suggestions regarding the management of osteoporosis. Girls and women with Turner syndrome have lower bone mineral density and a higher fracture rate than healthy individuals. The most important risk factors for osteoporosis are inadequately treated primary ovarian insufficiency, followed by intrinsic bone abnormalities. Comorbidities that further increase the risk of osteoporosis include vitamin D deficiency, celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, hearing problems can predispose to falls. Early initiation of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) at the age of 11-13 years, prompt titration to the adult dose after 2 years and long-term follow-up to ensure compliance with HRT are the cornerstones of osteoporosis prevention in women with Turner syndrome.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Uncertainty was examined using probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses, together with a scenario analysis incorporating a different perspective.\nRESULTS:\niCBT was slightly more expensive than the waiting list control, but also more effective, resulting in incremental cost-utility ratios of €23,331/QALY and €11,277/QALY for the guided and self-managed formats, respectively. A significant reduction in overall levels of menopausal symptoms or perceived impact of HF/NS resulted in incremental costs between €1460 and €1525 for the guided and €500-€753 for the self-managed format. The estimated annual budget impact for the Netherlands was €192,990 for the guided and €74,592 for the self-managed format.\nCONCLUSION:\nBased on the current trial data, the results indicate that both guided and self-managed iCBT are cost-effective with a willingness-to-pay threshold of well below €30,000/QALY.

Women with early menarche and nulliparity or low parity are also at a higher risk of experiencing premature or early menopause. Cigarette smoking (with a strong dose-response effect) and being underweight have been consistently associated with premature and early menopause. Current guidelines for the management of premature and early menopause mainly focus on early initiation of hormone therapy (HT) and continued treatment until the woman reaches the average age at menopause (50-52 years). We suggest that clinicians and health professionals consider the age at menopause of the relevant region or ethnic group as part of the assessment for the timing of HT cessation. In addition, there should be early monitoring of women with a family history of early menopause, who are a child of a multiple pregnancy, or who have had early menarche (especially those who have had no children). As part of preventive health strategies, women should be encouraged to quit smoking (preferably before the age of 30 years) and maintain optimal weight in order to reduce their risk of premature or early menopause.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Increasing data from experimental animal models and epidemiological studies indicate that exposure to a number of ubiquitously distributed reproductively toxic environmental chemicals (RTECs) can contribute to earlier menopause and even premature ovarian failure. However, the causative relationship between environmental chemical exposure and earlier menopause in women remains poorly understood. The present work, is an attempt to review the current evidence regarding the effects of RTECs on the main ovarian activities in mammals, focusing on how such compounds can affect the ovarian reserve at any stages of ovarian development. We found that in rodents, strong evidence exists that in utero, neonatal, prepubescent and even adult exposure to RTECs leads to impaired functioning of the ovary and a shortening of the reproductive lifespan. Regarding human, data from cross-sectional surveys suggest that human exposure to certain environmental chemicals can compromise a woman's reproductive health and in some cases, correlate with earlier menopause. In conclusion, evidences exist that exposure to RTECs can compromise a woman's reproductive health. However, human exposures may date back to the developmental stage, while the adverse effects are usually diagnosed decades later, thus making it difficult to determine the association between RTECs exposure and human reproductive health. Therefore, epidemiological surveys and more experimental investigation on humans, or alternatively primates, are needed to determine the direct and indirect effects caused by RTECs exposure on the ovary function, and to characterize their action mechanisms."}, {"authors": ["Pan Z", "Cui J", "Shan G", "Chou Y", "Pan L", "Sun Z", "Cui Z", "Sun J", "Cao Y", "Zhao J", "Ma X", "Ma J", "He H", "Ma J", "Zhong Y"], "topic": "Menopause", "title": "Prevalence and risk factors for pterygium: a cross-sectional study in Han and Manchu ethnic populations in Hebei, China.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6398733/", "publication": "BMJ Open. 2019 Feb 21;9(2):e025725. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025725.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nAIMS:\nTo investigate the prevalence, ethnic differences and associated risk factors for pterygium in Han and Manchu populations aged 40-79 years in Hebei province, China.\nDESIGN:\nCross-sectional study, as a part of the China National Health Survey.\nSETTING:\nHebei province, China.\nPARTICIPANTS:\nA multistage cluster sampling method with urbanisation level-based stratification was used to select participants for this study.

Our aim was to determine the association between body mass index (BMI) and surgical menopausal symptoms.\nMETHODS:\nWe report a retrospective review of endometrial cancer patients whom underwent menopause secondary to their surgical staging procedure. Symptoms were classified as severe if treatment was prescribed, or mild if treatment was offered, but declined. Univariate analysis was performed with ANOVA and Chi-square tests as appropriate. Relative risks (RR) were generated from Poisson regression models.\nRESULTS:\nWe identified 166 patients in whom the BMI (kg/m2) distribution was as follows: 33 (19.9%) had BMI <30, 49 (29.5%) had BMI 30-39.9, 50 (30.1%) had BMI 40-49.9, and 34 (20.5%) had BMI ≥50. There were no differences in race, age, or adjuvant treatment among the groups. Overall, 65 (39.2%) women reported symptoms of surgical menopause, including 19 (11.4%) mild and 46 (27.7%) severe. Symptom type did not differ by BMI; however, the prevalence of severe menopausal symptoms decreased with increasing BMI: <30 (45.5%), 30-39.9 (30.6%), 40-49.9 (22%), and ≥ 50 (14.7%); P = 0.002. Multivariate analysis confirmed that symptom prevalence decreased with increasing BMI.

Hormone therapy (HT) is recommended for women with no contraindications. However, HT is greatly underutilized among these women due to their fear of the associated risks. The objective of this study is to identify and describe determinants of HT uptake and decision-making in women after surgical menopause. Methods We searched Medline, EMBASE, and CINAHL, from inception to April 2018, to identify relevant literature. Inclusion criteria included studies that assessed factors affecting the uptake of HT and decision-making about HT after surgical menopause. Studies including both women with natural and surgical menopause were included. Search terms were derived from 3 main concepts: surgical menopause, hormone therapy, and decision-making. Papers included in the review had to be in the English language and to report human studies. Results Of the 1952 articles identified, 23 were eligible for inclusion. Studies were mostly published before the WHI (61%) and had a quantitative cross-sectional study design. Only 22% focused on surgical menopause per se. The mean age at time of surgical menopause was 43.6 years (range 29-68). HT uptake was associated with younger age, higher level of education, higher income and adopting positive lifestyle behaviors. Factors affecting decision-making were mostly perceptions, beliefs, and values women associate with HT, as well as knowledge of and experiences with HT and surgical menopause. External factors related to physicians' recommendations and information sources also influenced HT decision-making. Conclusion Our review highlights the complex nature of decision-making about HT after surgical menopause and the numerous factors involved. Women tend to rely on subjective perceptions and inferences from information sources, which may hamper the ability to make informed treatment decisions. There is a need for tailored decision-aid interventions to help support women and guide informed treatment decisions.\nCopyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The etiopathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome has not been elucidated in detail. There are numerous hypotheses on this subject which tend to complement one another. The most widely recognized hypothesis is that the development of PCOS is due to insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, which subsequently lead to hyperandrogenism. On the basis of an as of yet relatively small number of studies, an increased prevalence of various psychiatric disorders can be observed in women with PCOS. These include: depression, generalized anxiety disorder, personality disorders, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and eating disorders. Bipolar affective disorder, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders have also been reported in women with PCOS more often than in the general population. The higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders in patients with PCOS, especially depression and anxiety disorders, may be due to both hyperandrogenism and the resulting somatic symptoms. These symptoms can undoubtedly be stigmatizing for women and lower their quality of life.

This study aims to report a literature review considering epidemiological and molecular mechanisms that correlate PCOS and breast cancer, as well as the influence of PCOS treatment on the incidence of breast cancer. Epidemiological studies failed to adjust potential variables that affect the risk and have thus provided inconclusive results. Molecular effects of androgenic pathways in breast cancer have been studied and androgens seem to have an inhibitory effect on mammary epithelial proliferation. However, increased bioavailable androgens were associated with recurrence of breast cancer due to conversion to oestrogens. Sex hormone-binding globulin has a role in hormone-dependent cancers and can be considered a marker for PCOS; a gene profile has already been linked to breast cancer risk in these patients. PCOS medical treatment is a promising tool for stratifying breast cancer risk due to the metabolic influence and hormonal environment. Clinical reports are inconsistent, emphasizing the need for further studies with a prospective design. In the future, the role of pharmacological interventions in PCOS will increase knowledge and awareness of breast cancer pathogenesis and will help to refine breast cancer risk stratification.\nCopyright © 2019.

Animal models of PCOS aids in studying various facts beginning from etiology to the treatment, hence, several animal models have been developed. Despite of the establishment of several models and a number of studies on PCOS, lacunae exist. This may be due to the failure in selecting a suitable animal model, as all animal models may not exhibit all the key features of the human PCOS condition or may exhibit traits similar to other diseased conditions in addition to the PCOS which should be excluded. Therefore, in this review, we have discussed the different animal models, features they exhibit, their merits and limitations which may aid in the selection of the relevant animal model of PCOS based upon the investigation's focus.

The mechanism of PCOS is not yet fully understood, but insulin resistance and genetic factors may play distinct roles in the pathomechanism. There is ongoing research on new therapeutic modalities for women with PCOS. In this minireview, we assessed the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of selected adjunctive agents (metformin, statins, resveratrol, melatonin, and inositols) for the treatment of women with PCOS. Metformin is a safe medication used in PCOS for 25 years that is currently recommended in select PCOS subpopulations, such as adolescents, women with metabolic disorders, and infertility infertile women undergoing ovarian hyperstimulation. Statins are also suggested in PCOS therapy, as these compounds decrease testosterone concentrations, improve lipid profiles, and ameliorate inflammatory reactions. Despite promising results, the role of statins in PCOS management needs to be further validated. Dietary supplements have also been tested in PCOS patients. Resveratrol was shown to decrease total testosterone production and improve fasting insulin but, until recently, only in one randomized study. Data on the therapeutic efficacy of melatonin and inositols on endocrine and metabolic abnormalities are limited and inconclusive. The multifactorial etiology of PCOS makes tailoring of its treatment more demanding, and there is a constant need for causative and effective modes of PCOS therapy.\nCopyright © 2019.

Because of the involvement of multiple pathways and the lack of common clues, PCOS demonstrates multifactorial properties and heterogeneity of symptoms. Recent studies have demonstrated that the core etiology and primary endocrine characteristics of PCOS are hyperandrogenemia (HA) and insulin resistance (IR). HA and IR are the main causes of PCOS and they can interplay each other in the occurrence and development of PCOS. Just because of this, the study about the effects of HA and IR on pathophysiology of various related symptoms of PCOS is very important to understand the pathogenesis of PCOS. This paper reviews the main symptoms of PCOS, including neuroendocrine disorders, reproductive processes, dyslipidemia, obesity, hypertension, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and sleep disordered breathing, which seriously affect the physical and mental health of PCOS women. The increasing knowledge of the development pattern of HA and IR in PCOS suggests that changes in diet and lifestyle, and the discovery of potential therapeutic agents may improve PCOS. However, further studies are needed to clarify the mutual influence and relation of HA and IR in development of PCOS. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge about the effects of HA and IR on PCOS.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

A reduction in plasma sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), a transport carrier that binds estrogen and androgens and regulates their biological activities, is often used as an indicator of hyperandrogenism in women with PCOS. Low serum SHBG levels are considered a biomarker of abnormal metabolism and are related to insulin resistance (IR), compensatory hyperinsulinemia and abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism in PCOS patients. SHBG is also associated with the long-term prognosis of PCOS. SHBG gene polymorphism is correlated with the risk of PCOS. As SHBG plays a vital role in the occurrence and development of PCOS, knowledge regarding its role in PCOS is helpful for further understanding the molecular mechanism of SHBG in PCOS development and providing new ideas for the treatment of female infertility. Hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α (HNF-4α) is a vital transcription factor in the SHBG synthesis process. HNF-4α binds to the cis-type element DR1 in the SHBG promoter to initiate transcription and regulates hepatic SHBG levels by modulating glucose and lipid metabolism and inflammatory factors. However, it remains unclear whether HNF-4α is indirectly involved in the pathogenesis of PCOS via regulation of hepatic SHBG synthesis. Therefore, this review discusses the interaction between SHBG and the various complications of PCOS as well as the regulatory effect of HNF-4α on SHBG expression.\nCopyright © 2019.

Among all subtypes, the TLR4 is a highly described transmembrane protein involved in the inflammatory process. The TLR4/myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) signaling pathway has been implicated in oncogenic events in several tissues and is associated with survival of patients. Through activation, TLR4 recruits adaptor proteins, i.e., MyD88 or TRIF, to triggers canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways that result in distinct immune responses. In most cancer cells, uncontrolled TLR4 signaling modifies the tumor microenvironment to proliferate and evade immune surveillance. By contrast, TLR4 activation can produce antitumor activities, thereby inhibiting tumor growth and enhancing the proper immune response. We review herein recent approaches on the role of the TLR4 signaling pathway and discuss potential candidates for gynecological cancer therapies; among these agents, natural and synthetic compounds have been tested both in vitro and in vivo. Since TLR4 ligands have been investigated as effective immune-adjuvants in the context of these aggressive malignancies, we described how TLR4 signaling controls part of the tumor-related inflammatory process and which are the new targeting molecules implicated in the regulation of tumorigenicity in ovarian, cervical, and endometrial cancers.\nCopyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Summary statistics were obtained for these SNPs from a GWAS meta-analysis of case-control analyses of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC; N = 63 347) and from a GWAS meta-analysis of retrospective cohort analyses of epithelial ovarian cancer among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers in the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA; N = 31 448). Across the 2 consortia, participants were enrolled between 1973 and 2014 and followed up through 2015. OCAC participants came from 14 countries and CIMBA participants came from 25 countries. SNPs were combined into multi-allelic models and mendelian randomization estimates representing lifelong inhibition of targets were generated using inverse-variance weighted random-effects models.\nEXPOSURES:\nPrimary exposure was genetically proxied inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase and secondary exposures were genetically proxied inhibition of NPC1L1 and PCSK9 and genetically proxied circulating LDL cholesterol levels.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:\nOverall and histotype-specific invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (general population) and epithelial ovarian cancer (BRCA1/2 mutation carriers), measured as ovarian cancer odds (general population) and hazard ratio (BRCA1/2 mutation carriers).\nRESULTS:\nThe OCAC sample included 22 406 women with invasive epithelial ovarian cancer and 40 941 control individuals and the CIMBA sample included 3887 women with epithelial ovarian cancer and 27 561 control individuals. Median ages for the cohorts ranged from 41.5 to 59.0 years and all participants were of European ancestry. In the primary analysis, genetically proxied HMG-CoA reductase inhibition equivalent to a 1-mmol/L (38.7-mg/dL) reduction in LDL cholesterol was associated with lower odds of epithelial ovarian cancer (odds ratio [OR], 0.60 [95% CI, 0.43-0.83]; P = .002). In BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, genetically proxied HMG-CoA reductase inhibition was associated with lower ovarian cancer risk (hazard ratio, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.51-0.93]; P = .01). In secondary analyses, there were no significant associations of genetically proxied inhibition of NPC1L1 (OR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.53-1.75]; P = .91), PCSK9 (OR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.85-1.13]; P = .80), or circulating LDL cholesterol (OR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.91-1.05]; P = .55) with epithelial ovarian cancer.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:\nGenetically proxied inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase was significantly associated with lower odds of epithelial ovarian cancer.

In this work, we systematically analyzed the inhibitory effects of ivermectin and the molecular mechanism of its action in ovarian cancer.\nMETHODS:\nThe effects of ivermectin alone and its combination with cisplatin on growth and survival were examined using cultured ovarian cancer cells and a xenograft mouse model. The molecular mechanism of action of ivermectin, focusing on Akt/mTOR signaling, was elucidated.\nRESULTS:\nIvermectin arrested growth in the G2/M phase and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in ovarian cancer, regardless of specific cellular and molecular differences. Ivermectin significantly augmented the inhibitory effect of cisplatin on ovarian cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, ivermectin suppressed the phosphorylation of key molecules in the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in ovarian cancer cells. In addition, overexpression of constitutively active Akt restored ivermectin-induced inhibition of Akt/mTOR, growth arrest and apoptosis. In an ovarian cancer xenograft mouse model, ivermectin alone significantly inhibited tumor growth. In combination with cisplatin, tumor growth was completely reversed over the entire duration of drug treatment without any toxicity. Furthermore, the concentrations of ivermectin used in our study are pharmacologically achievable.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nOur work suggests that ivermectin may be a useful addition to the treatment armamentarium for ovarian cancer and that targeting Akt/mTOR signaling is a therapeutic strategy to increase chemosensitivity in ovarian cancer.\nCopyright © 2019 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.

The increased UPBF is secondary to profound circumferential growth that extends from the downstream small spiral arteries to the upstream conduit main uterine artery. Although some of the mechanisms underlying uterine vascular remodeling are, in part, known, the factors that drive the remodeling are less clear. That higher circulating levels of estrogens are positively correlated with gestational uterine vascular remodeling suggests their involvement in this process. Estrogens binding to the estrogen receptors expressed in cytotrophoblast cells and in the uterine artery wall stimulate an outward hypertrophic remodeling of uterine vasculature. In preeclampsia, generally lower concentrations of estrogens limit the proper uterine remodeling, thereby reducing UPBF increases and restricting the growth of the fetus. This review aims to report estrogenic regulation of the maternal uterine circulatory adaptation in physiological and pathological pregnancy that favors vasodilation, and to consider the underlying molecular mechanisms by which estrogens regulate uteroplacental hemodynamics."}, {"authors": ["Mao-Draayer Y", "Thiel S", "Mills EA", "Chitnis T", "Fabian M", "Katz Sand I", "Leite MI", "Jarius S", "Hellwig K"], "topic": "High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy", "title": "Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders and pregnancy: therapeutic considerations.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41582-020-0313-y", "publication": "Nat Rev Neurol. 2020 Mar;16(3):154-170. doi: 10.1038/s41582-020-0313-y.

Meta-analyses of low-dose aspirin to prevent pre-eclampsia suggest that the incidence of preterm birth might also be decreased, particularly if initiated before 16 weeks of gestation.\nMETHODS:\nASPIRIN was a randomised, multicountry, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial of low-dose aspirin (81 mg daily) initiated between 6 weeks and 0 days of pregnancy, and 13 weeks and 6 days of pregnancy, in nulliparous women with an ultrasound confirming gestational age and a singleton viable pregnancy. Participants were enrolled at seven community sites in six countries (two sites in India and one site each in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guatemala, Kenya, Pakistan, and Zambia). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1, stratified by site) to receive aspirin or placebo tablets of identical appearance, via a sequence generated centrally by the data coordinating centre at Research Triangle Institute International (Research Triangle Park, NC, USA). Treatment was masked to research staff, health providers, and patients, and continued until 36 weeks and 7 days of gestation or delivery. The primary outcome of incidence of preterm birth, defined as the number of deliveries before 37 weeks' gestational age, was analysed in randomly assigned women with pregnancy outcomes at or after 20 weeks, according to a modified intention-to-treat (mITT) protocol. Analyses of our binary primary outcome involved a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by site, and generalised linear models to obtain relative risk (RR) estimates and associated confidence intervals. Serious adverse events were assessed in all women who received at least one dose of drug or placebo. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02409680, and the Clinical Trial Registry-India, CTRI/2016/05/006970.\nFINDINGS:\nFrom March 23, 2016 to June 30, 2018, 14 361 women were screened for inclusion and 11 976 women aged 14-40 years were randomly assigned to receive low-dose aspirin (5990 women) or placebo (5986 women). 5780 women in the aspirin group and 5764 in the placebo group were evaluable for the primary outcome. Preterm birth before 37 weeks occurred in 668 (11·6%) of the women who took aspirin and 754 (13·1%) of those who took placebo (RR 0·89 [95% CI 0·81 to 0·98], p=0·012). In women taking aspirin, we also observed significant reductions in perinatal mortality (0·86 [0·73-1·00], p=0·048), fetal loss (infant death after 16 weeks' gestation and before 7 days post partum; 0·86 [0·74-1·00], p=0·039), early preterm delivery (<34 weeks; 0·75 [0·61-0·93], p=0·039), and the incidence of women who delivered before 34 weeks with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (0·38 [0·17-0·85], p=0·015). Other adverse maternal and neonatal events were similar between the two groups.\nINTERPRETATION:\nIn populations of nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies from low-income and middle-income countries, low-dose aspirin initiated between 6 weeks and 0 days of gestation and 13 weeks and 6 days of gestation resulted in a reduced incidence of preterm delivery before 37 weeks, and reduced perinatal mortality.\nFUNDING:\nEunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.\nCopyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent studies have associated NLR with diagnosis of preeclampsia (PE).

In this study, we evaluate the potential diagnostic value of NLR in PE.\nMETHODS:\nWe searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases, Wanfang data, VIP database and China Biomedical Literature Database systematically for relevant literatures up to May 20, 2018. All analyses were conducted using Meta-DiSc1.4 and Stata 12.0 software. Sensitivity, specificity and other measures of accuracy of NLR for the diagnosis of PE were pooled.

The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.74 (95% CI 0.71-0.76) and 0.64 (95%CI 0.61-0.68), positive likelihood ratio, 2.62 (95%CI1.79-3.84); negative likelihood ratio, 0.34 (95%CI 0.24-0.48); diagnostic odds ratio, 8.44 (95%CI 4-17.78), and area under the curve was 0.82. Meta regression showed that sample size was the main source of heterogeneity.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess whether antenatal magnesium sulphate is associated with unintended adverse neonatal outcomes.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS:\nCINAHL, Cochrane Library, LILACS, MEDLINE, Embase, TOXLINE, and Web of Science, were searched (inceptions to 3 September 2019). Randomised, quasi-randomised, and non-randomised trials, cohort and case-control studies, and case reports assessing antenatal magnesium sulphate for pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, fetal neuroprotection, or tocolysis, compared with placebo/no treatment or a different magnesium sulphate regimen, were included. The primary outcome was perinatal death. Secondary outcomes included pre-specified and non-pre-specified adverse neonatal outcomes. Two reviewers screened 5,890 articles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias following Cochrane Handbook and RTI Item Bank guidance. For randomised trials, pooled risk ratios (RRs) or mean differences, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated using fixed- or random-effects meta-analysis. Non-randomised data were tabulated and narratively summarised. We included 197 studies (40 randomised trials, 138 non-randomised studies, and 19 case reports), of mixed quality. The 40 trials (randomising 19,265 women and their babies) were conducted from 1987 to 2018 across high- (16 trials) and low/middle-income countries (23 trials) (1 mixed). Indications included pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (24 trials), fetal neuroprotection (7 trials), and tocolysis (9 trials); 18 trials compared magnesium sulphate with placebo/no treatment, and 22 compared different regimens. For perinatal death, no clear difference in randomised trials was observed between magnesium sulphate and placebo/no treatment (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.10; 8 trials, 13,654 babies), nor between regimens. Eleven of 138 non-randomised studies reported on perinatal death. Only 1 cohort (127 babies; moderate to high risk of bias) observed an increased risk of perinatal death with >48 versus ≤48 grams magnesium sulphate exposure for tocolysis. No clear secondary adverse neonatal outcomes were observed in randomised trials, and a very limited number of possible adverse outcomes warranting further consideration were identified in non-randomised studies. Where non-randomised studies observed possible harms, often no or few confounders were controlled for (moderate to high risk of bias), samples were small (200 babies or fewer), and/or results were from subgroup analyses. Limitations include missing data for important outcomes across most studies, heterogeneity of included studies, and inclusion of published data only.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nOur findings do not support clear associations between antenatal magnesium sulphate for beneficial indications and adverse neonatal outcomes. Further large, high-quality studies (prospective cohorts or individual participant data meta-analyses) assessing specific outcomes, or the impact of regimen, pregnancy, or birth characteristics on these outcomes, would further inform safety recommendations.

Amongst them, preeclampsia (PE) is one of the most common. This review aims to describe the relationship between oxidative stress and inflammation in PE, aiming to reinforce its importance in the context of the disease and to discuss perspectives on clinical and nutritional treatment, in this line of research. Despite the still incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of PE, it is well accepted that there are placental changes in pregnancy, associated with an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species and the antioxidant defence system, characterizing the placental oxidative stress that leads to an increase in the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Hence, a generalized inflammatory process occurs, besides the presence of progressive vascular endothelial damage, leading to the dysfunction of the placenta. There is no consensus in the literature on the best strategies for prevention and treatment of the disease, especially for the control of oxidative stress and inflammation. In view of the above, it is evident the important connection between oxidative stress and inflammatory process in the pathogenesis of PE, being that this disease is capable of causing serious implications on both maternal and fetal health. Reports on the use of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds are analysed and still considered controversial. As such, the field is open for new basic and clinical research, aiming the development of innovative therapeutic approaches to prevent and to treat PE.\nCopyright © 2019 Marilene Brandão Tenório et al."}, {"authors": ["Lecarpentier E", "Gris JC", "Cochery-Nouvellon E", "Mercier E", "Abbas H", "Thadhani R", "Karumanchi SA", "Haddad B"], "topic": "High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy", "title": "Urinary Placental Growth Factor for Prediction of Placental Adverse Outcomes in High-Risk Pregnancies.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1097/AOG.0000000000003547", "publication": "Obstet Gynecol. 2019 Dec;134(6):1326-1332. doi: 10.1097/AOG.0000000000003547.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo evaluate whether urinary levels of placental growth factor (PlGF) during pregnancy are associated with the subsequent development of composite adverse outcomes (preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, placental abruption, perinatal death, maternal death) occurring at less than 34 weeks of gestation.\nMETHODS:\nThis is a preplanned ancillary study of the Heparin-Preeclampsia trial, a randomized trial in pregnant women with a history of severe early-onset preeclampsia (less than 34 weeks of gestation).

Original investigative findings suggest that abnormal placentation triggers preeclampsia and leads to hypertension, proteinuria, endothelial dysfunction, and inflammation, which are characteristics of the disease. Because of the regulatory roles that it plays in several metabolic processes, adiponectin has become a cytokine of interest in metabolic medicine. In this review, we have discussed the role of adiponectin in trophoblast proliferation, trophoblast differentiation, trophoblast invasion of the decidua, and decidual angiogenesis, which are the major phases of placentation. Also, we have highlighted the physiological profile of adiponectin in the course of normal pregnancy. Moreover, we have discussed the involvement of adiponectin in hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and proteinuria. Furthermore, we have summarized the reported relationship between the maternal serum adiponectin level and preeclampsia. The available evidence indicates that adiponectin level physiologically falls as pregnancy advances, regulates placentation, and exhibits protective effects against the symptoms of preeclampsia and that while hyperadiponectinemia is evident in normal-weight preeclamptic women, hypoadiponectinemia is evident in overweight and obese preeclamptic women. Therefore, the clinical use of adiponectin as a biomarker, therapeutic target, or therapeutic agent against the disease looks promising and should be considered.\n© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, {"authors": ["Alonso-Ventura V", "Li Y", "Pasupuleti V", "Roman YM", "Hernandez AV", "Pérez-López FR"], "topic": "High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy", "title": "Effects of preeclampsia and eclampsia on maternal metabolic and biochemical outcomes in later life: a systematic review and meta-analysis.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2019.154012", "publication": "Metabolism. 2020 Jan;102:154012. doi: 10.1016/j.metabol.2019.154012.

In comparison to controls, PE/E significantly increased systolic BP (MD = 8.3 mmHg, 95%CI 6.8 to 9.7), diastolic BP (MD = 6.8 mmHg, 95%CI 5.6 to 8.0), BMI (MD = 2.0 kg/m2; 95%CI 1.6 to 2.4), waist (MD = 4.3 cm, 95%CI 3.1 to 5.5), waist-to-hip ratio (MD = 0.02, 95%CI 0.01 to 0.03), weight (MD = 5.1 kg, 95%CI 2.2 to 7.9), total cholesterol (MD = 4.6 mg/dL, CI 1.5 to 7.7), LDL (MD = 4.6 mg/dL; 95%CI 0.2 to 8.9), triglycerides (MD = 7.7 mg/dL, 95%CI 3.6 to 11.7), glucose (MD = 2.6 mg/dL, 95%CI 1.2 to 4.0), insulin (MD = 19.1 pmol/L, 95%CI 11.9 to 26.2), HOMA-IR index (MD = 0.7, 95%CI 0.2 to 1.2), C reactive protein (MD = 0.05 mg/dL, 95%CI 0.01 to 0.09), and the risks of hypertension (RD = 0.24, 95%CI 0.15 to 0.33) and MetS (RD = 0.11, 95%CI 0.08 to 0.15). Also, PE/E reduced HDL levels (MD = -2.15 mg/dL, 95%CI -3.46 to -0.85). Heterogeneity of effects was high for most outcomes. Risk of bias was moderate across studies. Subgroup analyses showed similar effects as main analyses.\nCONCLUSION:\nWomen who had PE/E have worse metabolic and biochemical profile than those without PE/E in an intermediate to long term follow up period.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Hemochorial placentation requires fast and reliable hemostasis to guarantee survival of the mother, but also for the neonates. During human pregnancy, maternal platelet count decreases gradually from first, to second, and third trimester. In addition to hemodilution, accelerated platelet sequestration and consumption in the placental circulation may contribute to a decline of platelet count throughout gestation. Local stasis, turbulences, or damage of the syncytiotrophoblast layer can activate maternal platelets within the placental intervillous space and result in formation of fibrin-type fibrinoid. Perivillous fibrinoid is a regular constituent of the normal placenta which is considered to be an important regulator of intervillous hemodynamics, as well as having a role in shaping the developing villous trees. However, exaggerated activation of platelets at the maternal-fetal interface can provoke inflammasome activation in the placental trophoblast, and enhance formation of circulating platelet-monocyte aggregates, resulting in sterile inflammation of the placenta and a systemic inflammatory response in the mother. Hence, the degree of activation determines whether maternal platelets are a friend or foe of the human placenta. Exaggerated activation of maternal platelets can either directly cause or propagate the disease process in placenta-associated pregnancy pathologies, such as preeclampsia."}, {"authors": ["Ahmed A", "Williams DJ", "Cheed V", "Middleton LJ", "Ahmad S", "Wang K", "Vince AT", "Hewett P", "Spencer K", "Khan KS", "Daniels JP", "StAmP trial Collaborative Group"], "topic": "High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy", "title": "Pravastatin for early-onset pre-eclampsia: a randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled trial.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7063986/", "publication": "BJOG. 2020 Mar;127(4):478-488. doi: 10.1111/1471-0528.16013.

Statins can reduce sFlt-1 from cultured cells and improve pregnancy outcome in animals with a pre-eclampsia-like syndrome. We investigated the effect of pravastatin on plasma sFlt-1 levels during pre-eclampsia.\nDESIGN:\nBlinded (clinician and participant), proof of principle, placebo-controlled trial.\nSETTING:\nFifteen UK maternity units.\nPOPULATION:\nWe used a minimisation algorithm to assign 62 women with early-onset pre-eclampsia (24+0 -31+6  weeks of gestation) to receive pravastatin 40 mg daily (n = 30) or matched placebo (n = 32), from randomisation to childbirth.\nPRIMARY OUTCOME:\nDifference in mean plasma sFlt-1 levels over the first 3 days following randomisation.\nRESULTS:\nThe difference in the mean maternal plasma sFlt-1 levels over the first 3 days after randomisation between the pravastatin (n = 27) and placebo (n = 29) groups was 292 pg/ml (95% CI -1175 to 592; P = 0.5), and over days 1-14 was 48 pg/ml (95% CI -1009 to 913; P = 0.9). Women who received pravastatin had a similar length of pregnancy following randomisation compared with those who received placebo (hazard ratio 0.84; 95% CI 0.50-1.40; P = 0.6). The median time from randomisation to childbirth was 9 days (interquartile range [IQR] 5-14 days) for the pravastatin group and 7 days (IQR 4-11 days) for the placebo group. There were three perinatal deaths in the placebo-treated group and no deaths or serious adverse events attributable to pravastatin.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nWe found no evidence that pravastatin lowered maternal plasma sFlt-1 levels once early-onset pre-eclampsia had developed.

These observations led to the hypotheses that antiplatelet agents, low-dose aspirin in particular, might prevent or delay development of pre-eclampsia.\nOBJECTIVES:\nTo assess the effectiveness and safety of antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin and dipyridamole, when given to women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia.\nSEARCH METHODS:\nFor this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (30 March 2018), and reference lists of retrieved studies. We updated the search in September 2019 and added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review.\nSELECTION CRITERIA:\nAll randomised trials comparing antiplatelet agents with either placebo or no antiplatelet agent were included. Studies only published in abstract format were eligible for inclusion if sufficient information was available. We would have included cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials, if any had been identified in our search strategy. Quasi-random studies were excluded. Participants were pregnant women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia. Interventions were administration of an antiplatelet agent (such as low-dose aspirin or dipyridamole), comparisons were either placebo or no antiplatelet.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:\nTwo review authors assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat basis. For this update we incorporated individual participant data (IPD) from trials with this available, alongside aggregate data (AD) from trials where it was not, in order to enable reliable subgroup analyses and inclusion of two key new outcomes. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE.\nMAIN RESULTS:\nSeventy-seven trials (40,249 women, and their babies) were included, although three trials (relating to 233 women) did not contribute data to the meta-analysis. Nine of the trials contributing data were large (> 1000 women recruited), accounting for 80% of women recruited. Although the trials took place in a wide range of countries, all of the nine large trials involved only women in high-income and/or upper middle-income countries. IPD were available for 36 trials (34,514 women), including all but one of the large trials. Low-dose aspirin alone was the intervention in all the large trials, and most trials overall. Dose in the large trials was 50 mg (1 trial, 1106 women), 60 mg (5 trials, 22,322 women), 75mg (1 trial, 3697 women) 100 mg (1 trial, 3294 women) and 150 mg (1 trial, 1776 women). Most studies were either low risk of bias or unclear risk of bias; and the large trials were all low risk of bas. Antiplatelet agents versus placebo/no treatment The use of antiplatelet agents reduced the risk of proteinuric pre-eclampsia by 18% (36,716 women, 60 trials, RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.88; high-quality evidence), number needed to treat for one women to benefit (NNTB) 61 (95% CI 45 to 92). There was a small (9%) reduction in the RR for preterm birth <37 weeks (35,212 women, 47 trials; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.95, high-quality evidence), NNTB 61 (95% CI 42 to 114), and a 14% reduction infetal deaths, neonatal deaths or death before hospital discharge (35,391 babies, 52 trials; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.95; high-quality evidence), NNTB 197 (95% CI 115 to 681). Antiplatelet agents slightly reduced the risk of small-for-gestational age babies (35,761 babies, 50 trials; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.92; high-quality evidence), NNTB 146 (95% CI 90 to 386), and pregnancies with serious adverse outcome (a composite outcome including maternal death, baby death, pre-eclampsia, small-for-gestational age, and preterm birth) (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.96; 17,382 women; 13 trials, high-quality evidence), NNTB 54 (95% CI 34 to 132). Antiplatelet agents probably slightly increase postpartum haemorrhage > 500 mL (23,769 women, 19 trials; RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.12; moderate-quality evidence due to clinical heterogeneity), and they probably marginally increase the risk of placental abruption, although for this outcome the evidence was downgraded due to a wide confidence interval including the possibility of no effect (30,775 women; 29 trials; RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.54; moderate-quality evidence). Data from two large trials which assessed children at aged 18 months (including results from over 5000 children), did not identify clear differences in development between the two groups.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:\nAdministering low-dose aspirin to pregnant women led to small-to-moderate benefits, including reductions in pre-eclampsia (16 fewer per 1000 women treated), preterm birth (16 fewer per 1000 treated), the baby being born small-for-gestational age (seven fewer per 1000 treated) and fetal or neonatal death (five fewer per 1000 treated). Overall, administering antiplatelet agents to 1000 women led to 20 fewer pregnancies with serious adverse outcomes. The quality of evidence for all these outcomes was high. Aspirin probably slightly increased the risk of postpartum haemorrhage of more than 500 mL, however, the quality of evidence for this outcome was downgraded to moderate, due to concerns of clinical heterogeneity in measurements of blood loss. Antiplatelet agents probably marginally increase placental abruption, but the quality of the evidence was downgraded to moderate due to low event numbers and thus wide 95% CI. Overall, antiplatelet agents improved outcomes, and at these doses appear to be safe. Identifying women who are most likely to respond to low-dose aspirin would improve targeting of treatment. As almost all the women in this review were recruited to the trials after 12 weeks' gestation, it is unclear whether starting treatment before 12 weeks' would have additional benefits without any increase in adverse effects. While there was some indication that higher doses of aspirin would be more effective, further studies would be warranted to examine this.\nCopyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.

In 2018, there were 9,006 clinical isolates of gonococci from public and private sector sources tested for in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility by standardised methods. This was the highest annual total of isolates tested since the inception of the AGSP. The current treatment recommendation for gonorrhoea, for the majority of Australia, remains dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value ≥0.06 mg/L) was found nationally in 1.73% of isolates. The highest proportions were reported from Tasmania and non-remote Western Australia (7.3% and 2.1% respectively). In 2018 two extensively drug-resistant isolates were reported from Queensland patients. These two isolates, with ceftriaxone MIC values of 0.50 mg/L, high-level resistance to azithromycin (MIC ≥ 256 mg/L), and resistance to penicillin and ciprofloxacin were identified and reported to the World Health Organization as isolates of international significance. Resistance to azithromycin (MIC value ≥1.0 mg/L) was found nationally in 6.2% of isolates, lower than the 9.3% reported in 2017, but more than double the proportion reported in 2015 (2.6%). The highest proportions were reported from the Australian Capital Territory (8.7%), Victoria (8.3%), and New South Wales (6.5%). High-level resistance to azithromycin (MIC value ≥256 mg/L) was reported in nine isolates nationally in 2018: four from New South Wales, three from Victoria, and two from Queensland.

In remote Northern Territory penicillin resistance rates remain low (1.9%), and higher in remote Western Australia (6.5%). The proportion of isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin in non-remote Australia ranged from 10.3% in non-remote Northern Territory to 48.3% in South Australia.

STI are often extragenital and asymptomatic. Both can delay diagnosis and treatment. Approval of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) might have influenced sexual behaviour and STI-prevalence of HIV- MSM. We estimated STI-prevalence and risk factors amongst HIV- and HIV+ MSM in Germany to plan effective interventions.\nMETHODS:\nWe conducted a nationwide, cross-sectional study between February and July 2018. Thirteen MSM-friendly STI-practices screened MSM for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Mycoplasma genitalium (MG), Neisseria gonorrhea (NG), and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) using self-collected rectal and pharyngeal swabs, and urine samples. APTIMA™ STI-assays (Hologic™ Inc., San Diego, USA) were used for diagnostics, and samples were not pooled. We collected information on socio-demographics, HIV-status, clinical symptoms, sexual behaviour within the last 6 months, and PrEP use. We combined HIV status and PrEP use for defining risk groups, and used directed acyclic graphs and multivariable logistic regression to identify risk factors for STI.\nRESULTS:\nTwo thousand three hundred three MSM were included: 50.5% HIV+, median age 39 [18-79] years. Median number of male sex partners within the last 6 months was five. Sex without condom was reported by 73.6%, use of party drugs by 44.6%. 80.3% had a STI history, 32.2% of STI+ MSM reported STI-related symptoms. 27.6% of HIV- MSM used PrEP. Overall STI-prevalence was 30.1, 25.0% in HIV-/PrEP- MSM (CT:7.2%; MG:14.2%; NG:7.4%; TV:0%), 40.3% in HIV-/PrEP+ MSM (CT:13.8%; MG:19.4%; NG:14.8%; TV:0.4%), and 30.8% in HIV+ MSM (CT:10.1%; MG:18.4%; NG:8.6%; TV:0.1%).

As a relevant proportion of PrEP users will not use a condom, counselling and comprehensive STI screening is essential and should be low threshold and preferably free of cost.

However, the mechanisms underlying sexually transmitted infections in women and the link between the infection mechanism and the wide range of clinical outcomes remain elusive due to a lack of research models mimicking human infection in vivo.

We found that GC preferentially colonize the ectocervix by activating integrin-β1, which inhibits epithelial shedding. GC selectively penetrate into the squamocolumnar junction (TZ) and endocervical epithelia by inducing β-catenin phosphorylation, which leads to E-cadherin junction disassembly. Epithelial cells in various cervical regions differentially express carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs), the host receptor for GC opacity-associated proteins (OpaCEA). Relatively high levels were detected on the luminal membrane of ecto/endocervical epithelial cells but very low levels intracellularly in TZ epithelial cells. CEACAM-OpaCEA interaction increased ecto/endocervical colonization and reduced endocervical penetration by increasing integrin-β1 activation and inhibiting β-catenin phosphorylation respectively, through CEACAM downstream signaling. Thus, the intrinsic properties of cervical epithelial cells and phase-variation of bacterial surface molecules both play a role in controlling GC infection mechanisms and infectivity, preferential colonization or penetration, potentially leading to asymptomatic or symptomatic infection."}, {"authors": ["Smith AL", "Chen L"], "topic": "Gonorrhea", "title": "Incidence and Imminence of Pregnancy in At-Risk Teens After Emergency Department Visits.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1097/PEC.0000000000001989", "publication": "Pediatr Emerg Care. 2019 Dec;35(12):837-839. doi: 10.1097/PEC.0000000000001989.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nInterventions aimed at reducing teen pregnancy rates in the United States have focused on clinics and schools. Teens disproportionately seek care in emergency departments (EDs), making these an important and understudied arena for interventions to prevent subsequent unwanted pregnancies. Establishing the risk of subsequent pregnancy (SP) in this population is a necessary prelude to effective interventions. Therefore, we set out to measure the incidence and imminence of pregnancy in sexually active teens after an ED visit.\nMETHODS:\nA medical record review was conducted in an urban medical center with a general ED and a pediatric ED. Subjects were included if they were female individuals aged 13 to 19 years, were tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia in the EDs from 2004 to 2006, and were patients in the primary care clinics at the affiliated institution. Subsequent pregnancies were determined from the primary clinic charts. The duration of follow-up was 4 years.\nRESULTS:\nThree hundred ninety-eight subjects were included in the study. The mean age at ED visit was 17.3 years. A majority (70.1%) had a documented SP. For patients with an SP, the mean interval from ED visit to conception was 15.8 months. Patients who had an SP were significantly more likely to be an ethnic minority, to have tested positive for gonorrhea, and to have visited the adult ED.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nIn this population of sexually active teens, 70.1% became pregnant within 4 years of being tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia in the ED.

MtrD resembles the homologous Escherichia coli AcrB efflux protein with several common structural features, including an open cleft containing putative access and deep binding pockets proposed to interact with substrates. A highly discriminating N. gonorrhoeae strain, with the MtrD and NorM multidrug efflux pumps inactivated, was constructed and used to confirm and extend the substrate profile of MtrD to include 14 new compounds. The structural basis of substrate interactions with MtrD was interrogated by a combination of long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations and docking studies together with site-directed mutagenesis of selected residues. Of the MtrD mutants generated, only one (S611A) retained a wild-type (WT) resistance profile, while others (F136A, F176A, I605A, F610A, F612C, and F623C) showed reduced resistance to different antimicrobial compounds. Docking studies of eight MtrD substrates confirmed that many of the mutated residues play important nonspecific roles in binding to these substrates. Long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations of MtrD with its substrate progesterone showed the spontaneous binding of the substrate to the access pocket of the binding cleft and its subsequent penetration into the deep binding pocket, allowing the permeation pathway for a substrate through this important resistance mechanism to be identified. These findings provide a detailed picture of the interaction of MtrD with substrates that can be used as a basis for rational antibiotic and inhibitor design.IMPORTANCE With over 78 million new infections globally each year, gonorrhea remains a frustratingly common infection. Continuous development and spread of antimicrobial-resistant strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of gonorrhea, have posed a serious threat to public health. One of the mechanisms in N. gonorrhoeae involved in resistance to multiple drugs is performed by the MtrD multidrug resistance efflux pump. This study demonstrated that the MtrD pump has a broader substrate specificity than previously proposed and identified a cluster of residues important for drug binding and translocation. Additionally, a permeation pathway for the MtrD substrate progesterone actively moving through the protein was determined, revealing key interactions within the putative MtrD drug binding pockets. Identification of functionally important residues and substrate-protein interactions of the MtrD protein is crucial to develop future strategies for the treatment of multidrug-resistant gonorrhea.\nCopyright © 2019 Chitsaz et al."}, {"authors": ["Guerrero-Torres MD", "Menéndez MB", "Guerras CS", "Tello E", "Ballesteros J", "Clavo P", "Puerta T", "Vera M", "Ayerdi O", "Carrio JC", "Mozo I", "Del Romero J", "Vázquez JA", "Abad R"], "topic": "Gonorrhea", "title": "Epidemiology, molecular characterisation and antimicrobial susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates in Madrid, Spain, in 2016.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6805738/", "publication": "Epidemiol Infect. 2019 Sep 24;147:e274. doi: 10.1017/S095026881900150X.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the aim to elucidate gonococcal antimicrobial resistance (AMR)-risk factors, we undertook a retrospective analysis of the molecular epidemiology and AMR of 104 Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates from clinical samples (urethra, rectum, pharynx and cervix) of 94 individuals attending a sexually transmitted infection clinic in Madrid (Spain) from July to October 2016, and explored potential links with socio-demographic, behavioural and clinical factors of patients.

If not detected early, they have the potential to grow to a substantial size and can present with huge abdominal distention leading to various compression symptoms. Mucinous cystadenomas most commonly occur in the third to sixth decades of life, and rarely occur in extremes of age. The reported incidence of giant ovarian cystadenoma in postmenopausal women is low or relatively unknown due to widespread use of ultrasound and other radiological imaging modalities these days. Here, we report a case of giant mucinous cystadenoma in a 72-year-old postmenopausal woman with multiple comorbidities. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 72-year-old postmenopausal high-risk patient who presented with a huge abdominal distention which started gradually 1 year before. Abdominopelvic ultrasound showed a left giant multiloculated abdominal cyst. An intact 27-kg ovarian cyst was removed, and a total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) along with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) was performed. The final histopathological report showed a benign ovarian mucinous cystadenoma. CONCLUSIONS Mucinous cystadenoma is a benign neoplastic disease that can reach a massive size. They are rare in the postmenopausal age group, but when they do occur, they pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.

APT imaging was performed with three different presaturation pulse durations: 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 s. APT signal was defined as magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry at 3.5 ppm. The SI ratios of cyst to muscle calculated on T1- and T2-weighted images were defined as T1- and T2-ratios. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were also generated. We compared the three cystic lesion groups' APT signals, T1-ratio, T2-ratio, and ADC.\nRESULTS:\nWhen using 2.0 s of presaturation, the APT signals were 1.41 ± 0.71% in SCA, 5.15 ± 1.92% in MCA and 8.52 ± 1.17% in FC. Significant differences were observed between SCA and MCA (p < .01) and MCA and FC (p < .05), as well as between SCA and FC (P <  .0001). When 1.0 s presaturation pulse was used, similar results were obtained.

They usually develop in the small bowel mesentery, mesocolon (24%), retroperitoneum (14.5%), and very rarely originate from the sigmoid mesentery. Endometriomas represent a localized type of endometriosis and are usually within the ovary. Our case is unique because there are no reports in the literature of endometrial mesenteric cysts.\nPATIENT CONCERNS:\nWe present a case of a 29-year-old woman who underwent a routine gynecologic control.\nDIAGNOSIS:\nClinical examination and imaging identified 2 endometriomas on the left and posterior to the uterus.\nINTERVENTIONS:\nThe patient underwent exploratory laparoscopy. Unexpectedly, a 10 cm mesenteric cyst was identified; this was associated with adhesions in the left adnexal area and a left ovarian endometrioma. The classic surgical approach which was necessary identified the mesenteric cyst with cranial mesosigmoid and ileal adhesions, as well as distal adhesions which included the uterus, ileum, left ovarian endometrioma, left hydrosalpinx, left ureter, and rectum. The cyst was removed completely and a left adnexectomy was performed because of the presence of the endometrioma and adhesions.\nOUTCOMES:\nThe patient's outcome was favorable, with discharge at 72 hours after surgery. The histopathological report revealed that both the mesenteric and ovarian cysts were endometriomas.\nLESSONS:\nOur case is unusual in that a mesenteric cyst was identified in a patient with no clinical symptoms.

However, this treatment is not free from risk, since it is associated with a reduction in ovarian reserve. There is still controversy in the literature regarding whether the cause of the reduction in ovarian reserve is due to damage caused by the coagulation energy during hemostasis or whether the procedure itself is the cause of the damage irrespective of the hemostatic method used. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of different hemostatic methods on the ovarian function of women subjected to laparoscopic surgery for ovarian endometrioma.\nMETHODS:\nAn open-label randomized clinical trial to be conducted at the Lauro Wanderley University Hospital between December 2017 and August 2020. Eighty-four patients will be randomly allocated to three groups according to the hemostatic technique used during laparoscopic surgery for ovarian endometrioma: bipolar coagulation; laparoscopic suture; and hemostatic matrix. Ovarian function will be assessed by serum anti-Müllerian hormone measurement and by performing an antral follicle count using ultrasound before surgery and one, three, and six months after surgery.

She underwent a staging surgery due to an unexpected ovarian carcinoma from her frozen section. Laparotomy exploration, MRI and gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed no other abnormalities in the abdominal organs. She had a pelvic recurrence at 7 months and was alive with disease for 13 months at present. Gross examination showed a small mural nodule (l.0 × 0.5 × 0.2 cm) in the wall of the right ovarian cyst (18x15x14 cm). Microscopically, the neoplastic cells arranged in solid nests, crowded small irregular glands and scattered single cells. They had abundant cytoplasmic mucin and contained a significant component of signet ring cells. The stroma was desmoplastic and occasionally contained extracellular mucin deposits. The surrounding endometriotic cyst had several foci of atypical surface epithelium (atypical endometriotic cyst) that was continuous with the mucinous carcinoma.

No studies evaluated the benefits or harms of screening. Twenty-five studies (n = 15 785) evaluated the accuracy of screening tests; across individual studies and tests, sensitivity ranged from 0.36 to 1.0 and specificity ranged from 0.49 to 1.0. Among trials reporting findings from general obstetric populations (n = 7953), no significant association was observed between treatment and spontaneous delivery before 37 weeks (pooled absolute risk difference [ARD], -1.44% [95% CI, -3.31% to 0.43%]; 8 RCTs, n = 7571) or any delivery before 37 weeks (pooled ARD, 0.20% [95% CI, -1.13% to 1.53%]; 6 RCTs, n = 6307).

Meta-analyses of low-dose aspirin to prevent pre-eclampsia suggest that the incidence of preterm birth might also be decreased, particularly if initiated before 16 weeks of gestation.\nMETHODS:\nASPIRIN was a randomised, multicountry, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial of low-dose aspirin (81 mg daily) initiated between 6 weeks and 0 days of pregnancy, and 13 weeks and 6 days of pregnancy, in nulliparous women with an ultrasound confirming gestational age and a singleton viable pregnancy. Participants were enrolled at seven community sites in six countries (two sites in India and one site each in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guatemala, Kenya, Pakistan, and Zambia). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1, stratified by site) to receive aspirin or placebo tablets of identical appearance, via a sequence generated centrally by the data coordinating centre at Research Triangle Institute International (Research Triangle Park, NC, USA). Treatment was masked to research staff, health providers, and patients, and continued until 36 weeks and 7 days of gestation or delivery. The primary outcome of incidence of preterm birth, defined as the number of deliveries before 37 weeks' gestational age, was analysed in randomly assigned women with pregnancy outcomes at or after 20 weeks, according to a modified intention-to-treat (mITT) protocol. Analyses of our binary primary outcome involved a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by site, and generalised linear models to obtain relative risk (RR) estimates and associated confidence intervals. Serious adverse events were assessed in all women who received at least one dose of drug or placebo. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02409680, and the Clinical Trial Registry-India, CTRI/2016/05/006970.\nFINDINGS:\nFrom March 23, 2016 to June 30, 2018, 14 361 women were screened for inclusion and 11 976 women aged 14-40 years were randomly assigned to receive low-dose aspirin (5990 women) or placebo (5986 women). 5780 women in the aspirin group and 5764 in the placebo group were evaluable for the primary outcome. Preterm birth before 37 weeks occurred in 668 (11·6%) of the women who took aspirin and 754 (13·1%) of those who took placebo (RR 0·89 [95% CI 0·81 to 0·98], p=0·012). In women taking aspirin, we also observed significant reductions in perinatal mortality (0·86 [0·73-1·00], p=0·048), fetal loss (infant death after 16 weeks' gestation and before 7 days post partum; 0·86 [0·74-1·00], p=0·039), early preterm delivery (<34 weeks; 0·75 [0·61-0·93], p=0·039), and the incidence of women who delivered before 34 weeks with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (0·38 [0·17-0·85], p=0·015).

Underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that thrombin-induced colony-stimulating factor-2 (CSF-2) in decidual cells triggers paracrine signaling via its receptor (CSF2R) in trophoblasts, promoting fetal membrane weakening and abruption-associated PPROM. Decidua basalis sections from term (n = 10), idiopathic preterm birth (PTB; n = 8), and abruption-complicated pregnancies (n = 8) were immunostained for CSF-2. Real-time quantitative PCR measured CSF2 and CSF2R mRNA levels. Term decidual cell (TDC) monolayers were treated with 10-8 mol/L estradiol ± 10-7 mol/L medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) ± 1 IU/mL thrombin pretreatment for 4 hours, washed, and then incubated in control medium with estradiol ± MPA. TDC-derived conditioned media supernatant effects on fetal membrane weakening were analyzed. Immunostaining localized CSF-2 primarily to decidual cell cytoplasm and cytotrophoblast cell membranes. CSF-2 immunoreactivity was higher in abruption-complicated or idiopathic PTB specimens versus normal term specimens (P < 0.001). CSF2 mRNA was higher in TDCs versus cytotrophoblasts (P < 0.05), whereas CSF2R mRNA was 1.3 × 104-fold higher in cytotrophoblasts versus TDCs (P < 0.001). Thrombin enhanced CSF-2 secretion in TDC cultures fourfold (P < 0.05); MPA reduced this effect. Thrombin-pretreated TDC-derived conditioned media supernatant weakened fetal membranes (P < 0.05), which MPA inhibited. TDC-derived CSF-2, acting via trophoblast-expressed CSFR2, contributes to thrombin-induced fetal membrane weakening, eliciting abruption-related PPROM and PTB.\nCopyright © 2020 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess whether antenatal magnesium sulphate is associated with unintended adverse neonatal outcomes.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS:\nCINAHL, Cochrane Library, LILACS, MEDLINE, Embase, TOXLINE, and Web of Science, were searched (inceptions to 3 September 2019). Randomised, quasi-randomised, and non-randomised trials, cohort and case-control studies, and case reports assessing antenatal magnesium sulphate for pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, fetal neuroprotection, or tocolysis, compared with placebo/no treatment or a different magnesium sulphate regimen, were included. The primary outcome was perinatal death. Secondary outcomes included pre-specified and non-pre-specified adverse neonatal outcomes. Two reviewers screened 5,890 articles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias following Cochrane Handbook and RTI Item Bank guidance. For randomised trials, pooled risk ratios (RRs) or mean differences, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated using fixed- or random-effects meta-analysis. Non-randomised data were tabulated and narratively summarised. We included 197 studies (40 randomised trials, 138 non-randomised studies, and 19 case reports), of mixed quality. The 40 trials (randomising 19,265 women and their babies) were conducted from 1987 to 2018 across high- (16 trials) and low/middle-income countries (23 trials) (1 mixed). Indications included pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (24 trials), fetal neuroprotection (7 trials), and tocolysis (9 trials); 18 trials compared magnesium sulphate with placebo/no treatment, and 22 compared different regimens. For perinatal death, no clear difference in randomised trials was observed between magnesium sulphate and placebo/no treatment (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.10; 8 trials, 13,654 babies), nor between regimens. Eleven of 138 non-randomised studies reported on perinatal death. Only 1 cohort (127 babies; moderate to high risk of bias) observed an increased risk of perinatal death with >48 versus ≤48 grams magnesium sulphate exposure for tocolysis. No clear secondary adverse neonatal outcomes were observed in randomised trials, and a very limited number of possible adverse outcomes warranting further consideration were identified in non-randomised studies. Where non-randomised studies observed possible harms, often no or few confounders were controlled for (moderate to high risk of bias), samples were small (200 babies or fewer), and/or results were from subgroup analyses. Limitations include missing data for important outcomes across most studies, heterogeneity of included studies, and inclusion of published data only.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nOur findings do not support clear associations between antenatal magnesium sulphate for beneficial indications and adverse neonatal outcomes. Further large, high-quality studies (prospective cohorts or individual participant data meta-analyses) assessing specific outcomes, or the impact of regimen, pregnancy, or birth characteristics on these outcomes, would further inform safety recommendations.

Women with continuous bleeding after placental delivery following CD for placenta previa, who failed to respond to uterotonics, suturing and uterine devascularization, and in the absence of suspected deeply invasive accreta were eligible subjects. Eligible subjects were randomized to receive intrauterine double-balloon catheter (n = 102) or gauze packing (n = 102). The main outcome was the rate of successful hemostasis without the need for additional surgical interventions. The secondary outcomes included the volume of blood loss during and after CD, the rate of PPH, incidence and amount of blood transfusion, hysterectomy, surgical complications, intensive care unit admission, need for re-laparotomy, length of hospital stay, and readmission.\nRESULTS:\nThe 224 participants were recruited before delivery, with 20 excluded (14 cases bleeding stopped after uterotonics and/or local myometrium sutures and 6 patients with placental increta).

Many studies have sought to identify risk factors for post-delivery pain in different populations, using different methodologies and different outcome variables. Studies of several different but interrelated post-partum pain syndromes have been conducted. Factors strongly and specifically associated with persistent incisional scar pain after Caesarean delivery include a coexisting persistent pain problem in another part of the body and severe acute postoperative pain. For persistent vaginal and perineal pain, operative vaginal delivery and the magnitude of perineal trauma have been consistently linked. History of pregnancy-related and pre-pregnancy back pain and heavier body weight are robust risk factors for persistent back pain after pregnancy. Unfortunately, limitations, particularly small samples and lack of a priori sample size calculation designed to detect specific effect sizes for risk of persistent pain outcomes, preclude definitive conclusions about many other predictors and the strength of outcome associations. In future studies, assessments of specific phenotypes using a rigorous analysis with appropriate predetermined sample sizes and validated instruments are needed to allow elucidation of stronger and reliable associations. Interventional studies targeting the most robustly associated, modifiable risk factors, such as acute post-partum pain, may lead to solutions for the prevention and treatment of these common problems that impact a large population.\nCopyright © 2020 British Journal of Anaesthesia.

We conducted a double-blind, dose-finding study of carbetocin using a biased coin up-and-down design in women with a body mass index ≥ 40 kg.m-2 undergoing elective caesarean section.

Among mothers with fistula giving birth to a stillborn baby, the CS rate (overall 54.8%, 2027/3695) rose from 45% (162/361) in 1990-94 to 64% (331/514) in 2010-14.

Contrary to international recommendations, alternatives such as vacuum extraction, forceps and destructive delivery are decreasingly used. Unless uterine rupture is suspected, CS should be avoided in obstructed labour with intrauterine fetal death to avoid complications related to CS scars in subsequent pregnancies.

Current consensus recommendations for resource-rich settings suggest the use of a titrated phenylephrine infusion, in combination with fluid coloading, for prevention of maternal hypotension. In resource-limited settings, where syringe drivers are unavailable, these recommendations advise the addition of 500 μg phenylephrine to the first 1 l of intravenous fluid given after initiation of spinal anaesthesia, with additional vasopressor boluses as required. This prospective, alternating intervention study compared the use of a conventional phenylephrine rescue bolus strategy for prevention of hypotension, defined as systolic arterial pressure < 90 mmHg, with a phenylephrine infusion given according to the consensus recommendation. We studied 300 women having elective caesarean section. There were 77 (51%) women who developed hypotension in the bolus group vs. 55 (37%) in the phenylephrine infusion group (p = 0.011). This represented a 29% reduction in hypotension, with a number needed to treat of 6.8. The six highest systolic arterial pressure readings occurred in the phenylephrine infusion group (range 166-188 mmHg), and there were four instances of bradycardia (heart rate < 50 beats.min-1 ) with preserved systolic arterial pressure in each group. There were no adverse clinical sequelae, and no differences in neonatal Apgar scores in either group.

Thrombosis of the umbilical cord leads to fetal hypoxia, which jeopardizes fetal health and can cause fetal death. Umbilical vessel thrombosis, which is rarely reported, is difficult to detect prenatally.\nPATIENT CONCERNS:\nBoth pregnant women had an unremarkable pregnancy course until a routine ultrasound scan in the third trimester showed a single umbilical artery. However, one umbilical vein and 2 umbilical arteries were seen during an ultrasound examination at 32 weeks. Case 2 had a better pregnancy outcome because of the timely discovery of this complication.\nDIAGNOSIS:\nBoth cases were diagnosed as umbilical artery thrombosis.\nINTERVENTIONS:\nThe first patient received no interventions until they reported decreased fetal movements and gradually disappear. The second patient underwent an emergency cesarean section.\nOUTCOMES:\nIn Case 1, an emergency ultrasound examination showed intrauterine fetal death, and the patient vaginally delivered a stillborn child weighing 3300 g in a day. In Case 2, a female neonate weighing 2860 g was delivered by cesarean section, and exhibited Apgar scores of 10 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes.\nCONCLUSION:\nIn the late-term abortions, obstetricians should be vigilant if ultrasound imaging shows suspected umbilical vascular thrombosis or shows 1 umbilical artery when there had previously been 2.

Due to the physiological changes in airway anatomy, parturient had higher incidences of difficult airway than non-obstetric population. Accurate airway assessment is the first step and the most important in airway management. However, the common clinical screening tests, shown low sensitivity and specificity with a limited predictive value. Ultrasound is a quick, noninvasive, inexpensive tool, with the advancement of ultrasound technology, modern ultrasound machine is more portable with better resolution and enhanced tissue penetration, provide better imaging in tissues like epiglottis, vocal cords, ring-shaped membrane, and can be used in airway assessment. Here, the aim of the current study was to find whether preoperative ultrasound assessment of neck anatomy can predict difficult airway in parturient, and provide new ideas and a theoretical basis in the airway management of obstetric anesthesia.\nMETHODS:\nThis is a prospective, observational single-blinded study in a single-center. Subjects will be recruited from patients aged from 18 to 60 years, gestational age ≥ 36 weeks, scheduled for cesarean section under general anesthesia and tracheal intubation. Ultrasound measurement will be performed to detect anterior cervical soft tissue thickness at five anatomical levels (hyoid bone, epiglottis, cricothyroid membrane, thyroid isthmus and suprasternal notch) in the upper airway. The thickness of the soft tissue in the front of the neck and clinical airway measurements will be compared between the \"easy intubation\" and \"difficult intubation\" group divided by Cormack-Lehane grade. Receiver-operating characteristic curves were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of \"difficulty prediction capability\" of each sonographic and physical measurements. Clinical factors associated with difficult intubation will be determined by univariate analyses. Multiple logistic regression analysis performed to determine independent predictors of difficult intubation.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThe study outlined in this protocol will explore the possibility of ultrasound for predicting difficult airway in obstetric anesthesia.

The pathological changes and clinical outcomes were reviewed. In this specific case, the development of syphilitic cerebral arteritis was dynamic, continuous, and rapid. The pathogenesis was related to Heubner arteritis, in which the formation of a mural thrombus (MT) causes the severe obstruction of blood flow without complete occlusion, leading to an increased risk of infarction. In this patient, formation of the MT resulted in the infarction of the smaller vessels and narrowing of the larger vessels. The partial dislodgment of the MT from the arterial wall of the larger vessels occluded the smaller vessels, leading to infarction.\nINTERVENTIONS:\nStandard pharmacotherapy for the treatment of the cerebral infarction and a single course of penicillin were applied.\nOUTCOMES:\nMuscle strength was recovered. The Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15, whereas the NIH Stroke Scale score was 0. The increase in blood flow of the right MCA was accompanied by severe stenosis with compensation of the anterior communicating artery. In addition, moderate to severe stenosis of the right vertebral artery and the basilar artery was suspected.

However, its intramuscular (IM) administration is associated with pain at the site of injection. The dilution of PGB with local anesthetics is recommended in some guidelines, but the evidence that supports it, particularly in adults and in HIV infection, is scarce. Preliminary clinical experience also suggests that the IM administration of PGB through increased needle gauges might improve its tolerability. The aim of the study to identify less painful ways of administering IM PGB in the treatment of syphilis in adults.\nMETHODS:\nMulticenter, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial in patients diagnosed with primary syphilis that required a single IM injection of PGB 2400,00 IU. Patients were randomized to receive PGB diluted with 0.5 mL mepivacaine 1% (MV) or PGB alone, and both groups either with a long 19G or short 21G IM needle. The primary objective was the effect on local pain immediately after the administration through a visual scale questionnaire on pain (0 to 10).\nRESULTS:\nOne hundred eight patients were included, 27 in each group. Ninety-four (94.4%) were male, and 41.7% were also HIV-infected. Mean age 36.6 years (SD 11). Significant differences in immediate pain intensity were observed when comparing the long 19G group with anesthesia (mean pain intensity, [MPI] 2.92 [CI 95% 1.08-4.07]) vs long 19G without anesthesia (MPI 5.56 [CI 95% 4.39-6.73), p < 0.001; and also between short 21G group with anesthesia (MPI 3.36 [CI 95% 2.22-4.50]) vs short 21G without anesthesia (MPI 5.06 [CI 95% 3.93-6.19]), p = 0.015). No significant differences in immediate pain were observed between 19G and 21G in the presence or absence of anesthesia (p = 1.0 in both cases). No differences were found between study arms after 6 and 24 h.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThe IM administration of 1% mepivacaine-diluted PGB induces significantly less immediate local pain as compared to PGB alone. The needle gauge did not have any effect on the pain. Based on these results, we suggest anesthetic-diluted IM PGB as the standard treatment for primary syphilis.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION:\nEudraCT 2014-003969-24 (Date of registration 18/09/2014)."}, {"authors": ["Jacobs K", "Vu DM", "Mony V", "Sofos E", "Buzi N"], "topic": "Syphilis", "title": "Congenital Syphilis Misdiagnosed as Suspected Nonaccidental Trauma.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2019-1564", "publication": "Pediatrics. 2019 Oct;144(4). pii: e20191564. doi: 10.1542/peds.2019-1564.

The treatment of uterine fibroids may be medical, surgical, conservative or expectant. Myomectomy is the common surgical treatment option for women failing medical management and desiring to preserve fertility and/or their uterus. The tourniquet is shown to be effective in reducing blood loss during myomectomy and tranexamic to a less extent. However, the adjunctive use of tranexamic acid with tourniquet to further reduce blood loss has not been studied.\nAIM:\nThe aim of the study was to determine the efficacy of perioperative intravenous tranexamic acid in further reducing blood loss at abdominal myomectomy when used as an adjunct to tourniquet.\nMETHODS:\nThe study was a randomized double-blind controlled study involving women who underwent abdominal myomectomy. Participants were randomized to either tourniquet plus intravenous tranexamic acid or tourniquet plus placebo groups using simple random sampling. The primary outcomes were the intra-operative blood loss, post-operative haematocrit values and need for intra-operative blood transfusion. The data was analyzed using the SPSS software version 23.0 and p value < 0.05 was significant.\nRESULTS:\nThe mean intra-operative blood loss (998.72 ± 607.21 ml vs 907.25 ± 529.85 ml, p = 0.475), intra-operative blood transfusion rate (45% vs. 30%; p = 0.166) and mean unit of blood transfused (1.13 ± 1.64 vs. 0.75 ± 1.28; p = 0.256) were higher for tourniquet plus placebo group compared to tourniquet plus tranexamic acid group. The estimated blood loss per 100 g of fibroid removed was reduced significantly in the tranexamic acid plus tourniquet group (139.80 ± 2.28 ml vs 104.09 ± 1.97 ml; p = 0.001).\nSTRENGTH AND LIMITATIONS:\nThe strength of the study include randomization and blinding. The limitations included non-uniformity of sizes and locations of fibroids, as well as the different surgeons with possibly different skills, techniques and experiences, though they were statistically not significant.\nCONCLUSION:\nThe adjunctive use of tranexamic acid to tourniquet significantly further reduces intraoperative blood loss during abdominal myomectomy when compared to tourniquet alone.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\nAdjunctive use of tranexamic acid is recommended for further reducing intra-operative blood loss during abdominal myomectomy.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The primary objective of this study was to document the incidence of de novo uterine adhesions after transcervical fibroid ablation (TFA) of symptomatic uterine fibroids with the Sonata® system.\nSTUDY DESIGN:\nIn this European postmarket prospective, multicenter, single-arm interventional trial, patients were eligible for inclusion if they chose TFA with the Sonata System for symptomatic fibroids and had at least 1 type 1, type 2 or type 2-5 myoma. The presence or absence of intrauterine adhesions was assessed by diagnostic hysteroscopy at baseline and at 6 weeks post-ablation. The hysteroscopy videos were scored by a committee of 3 independent readers.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 6 sites enrolled 37 patients. Fifty fibroids with a mean diameter of 3.4 ± 1.8 cm (range 1-8 cm) were ablated. Of the 37 enrolled subjects, 35 completed the study follow-up and 2 electively withdrew from the study prior to the completion of study follow-up. Thirty-four out of 35 pairs of baseline and 6-week hysteroscopies were evaluated by the independent readers with none having de novo adhesions at 6 weeks after treatment with Sonata, including 6 patients with apposing myomata. One patient was excluded from the analysis due to an unevaluable hysteroscopy video.\nCONCLUSION:\nIntrauterine adhesiogenesis was not seen post-TFA with the Sonata system. These results suggest the potential for adhesiogenesis after TFA, including in women with apposing submucous and/or transmural myomata, may be minimal.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The requirement for surgery decreased with the use of UPA, with 54% of women undergoing surgery after treatment. The reduction in surgery performed was lower for women willing to conceive (40%) compared to women who were not (49%). The volume of the fibroids decreased significantly, with the largest measured fibroid decreasing by 50%. Bleeding and pain were significantly decreased with the use of UPA. No major complications were recorded, and no liver function abnormalities were reported during the treatment and in follow-up.\nCONCLUSION:\nBy administering UPA, the required rate of surgery was significantly decreased.

However, its use in women with uterine fibroids is widely debated, based on the susceptibility of these tumors to sexual steroids. This review aims to ascertain the effects of HRT on leiomyomas development and growth in postmenopausal women. Materials and Methods: Electronic databases (i.e., MEDLINE, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, EMBASE, Sciencedirect, the Cochrane Library at the CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, Scielo) were searched from January 1990 until May 2019. All English-written studies evaluating the impact of various HRT regimens on uterine leiomyomas were selected. Results: Seventeen papers, considering a total of 1122 participants, were included. Fifteen of these were prospective trials, of which nine were randomized controlled trials. The remaining two works were a retrospective observational trial and a retrospective case series respectively. Five studies evaluated the effects of tibolone, also comparing it with various estrogen/progestin combinations, while two were about raloxifene. Thirteen studies compared different combinations of estrogens/progestins, the most common being transdermal estrogens (used in nine studies) and medroxyprogesterone acetate at different doses (used in 10 studies). Conclusions: For women with uterine fibroids, the choice of the most appropriate HRT regimen is crucial to avoid leiomyomas growth and the symptoms possibly related to it. Available data are conflicting, but suggest that uterine fibroids might be influenced by HRT, without representing an absolute contraindication to hormonal replacement therapy. Women with uterine fibroids subjected to HRT should be periodically examined and hormonal treatment should be discontinued if leiomyomas appear to increase in size. Moreover, the minimal effective dose of progestin should be employed."}, {"authors": ["Odejinmi F", "Aref-Adib M", "Liou N", "Sideris M", "Mallick R"], "topic": "Uterine Fibroids", "title": "Rethinking the Issue of Power Morcellation of Uterine Fibroids: Is Morcellation the Real Problem or Is this Another Symptom of Disparity in Healthcare Provision?", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6754994/", "publication": "In Vivo. 2019 Sep-Oct;33(5):1393-1401. doi: 10.21873/invivo.11616.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nPower morcellation remains one of the most significant developments in minimal access surgery over the past decade, allowing many more patients to benefit from the least invasive surgical route.

This may result in extensive intraoperative bleeding and the need for a conversion to a laparotomy. Medical pretreatment prior to surgery might reduce these risks by decreasing fibroid size and vascularization of the fibroid. We compared pretreatment with ulipristal acetate (UPA) vs gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) prior to laparoscopic myomectomy on several intra- and postoperative outcomes.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS:\nWe performed a non-inferiority double-blind randomized controlled trial in nine hospitals in the Netherlands. Women were randomized between daily oral UPA for 12 weeks and single placebo injection or single intramuscular injection with leuprolide acetate and daily placebo tablets for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was intraoperative blood loss. Secondary outcomes were reduction of fibroid volume, suturing time, total surgery time and surgical ease.\nRESULTS:\nThirty women received UPA and 25 women leuprolide acetate. Non-inferiority of UPA regarding intraoperative blood loss was not demonstrated. When pretreated with UPA, median intraoperative blood loss was statistically significantly higher (525 mL [348-1025] vs 280 mL[100-500]; P = 0.011) and suturing time of the first fibroid was statistically significantly longer (40 minutes [28-48] vs 22 minutes [14-33]; P = 0.003) compared with GnRHa. Pretreatment with UPA showed smaller reduction in fibroid volume preoperatively compared with GnRHa (-7.2% [-35.5 to 54.1] vs -38.4% [-71.5 to -19.3]; P = 0.001). Laparoscopic myomectomies in women pretreated with UPA were subjectively judged more difficult than in women pretreated with GnRHa.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nNon-inferiority of UPA in terms of intraoperative blood loss could not be established, possibly due to the preliminary termination of the study. Pretreatment with GnRHa was more favorable than UPA in terms of fibroid volume reduction, intraoperative blood loss, hemoglobin drop directly postoperatively, suturing time of the first fibroid and several subjective surgical ease parameters.\n© 2019 The Authors.

Though long-term HPV infection may induce vulva tumor, but the relationship between HPV infection and collision vulva tumor is not clear. And there are no clear rules of the post-hysterectomy cancer surveillance for human papilloma virus (HPV) long-term infections. So here we first report a case of post-hysterectomy rare collision vulva tumor with long-term HPV infection composed of squamous cell carcinoma of the labia major and adenosquamous carcinoma of bartholin gland and hope to bring new direction to our future research.\nPATIENT CONCERNS:\nA 48-year-old woman with long-term HPV infection, 3 years after hysterectomy, gravida 3, para 2, was admitted to our hospital with complaints of a 4-month history of an itching vulva ulceration. An anabrosis was located on the surface of the solid mass of the bartholin gland at the posterior part of the right labium and the right inguinal lymph nodes were palpable. Result of the incisional biopsy of the ulcer area at local hospital was atypical squamous cells couldn't exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H). Subsequently more authoritative pathological consultation results suggested squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva.\nDIAGNOSES:\nPost-hysterectomy collision vulva tumor with long-term HPV infection composed of squamous cell carcinoma of the labia major and adenosquamous carcinoma of bartholin gland.\nINTERVENTIONS:\nThe extensive excision of the vulva, bilateral inguinal lymph nodes dissection, and local skin flap transposition surgeon was done to this patient. The final certificate diagnosis was: vulvar tumor T1bM0N0 composed of squamous cell carcinoma of the labia major and adenosquamous carcinoma of bartholin gland; HPV infection; post hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingectomy.\nOUTCOMES:\nThe patient recovered well after surgery, and consequently received 6 courses of TC (paclitaxel + carboplatin) chemotherapy, and 9 months and 13 days followed up. So far patient recorded as complete response (CR).\nLESSONS:\nCollision vulva tumor occurred post-hysterectomy is extremely rare. It is most likely related to long-term HPV infection, which suggests us should to modify the manner of the post-hysterectomy cancer surveillance for HPV long-term infections. For patients with high-risk HPV infection, even if the cytology results are negative, we may should perform colposcopy and vulva biopsy more positively to prevent the disease from progressing into cancer. And the pathogenesis of relationship between HPV infection and collision vulva tumor is still need further investigation."}, {"authors": ["Vaccari S", "Barisani A", "Salvini C", "Pirola S", "Preti EP", "Pennacchioli E", "Iacobone AD", "Patrizi A", "Tosti G"], "topic": "Vulvar Cancer", "title": "Thin vulvar melanoma: a challenging diagnosis.

We particularly focused on their dermoscopic characteristics to highlight the most suggestive dermoscopic diagnostic clues.\nRESULTS:\nIn total, 14 cases of early-stage VM were included, in women with a mean age at diagnosis of 64.86 years. The most frequently affected sites were the labia minora. Of these, 11 cases were unifocal. Dermoscopy most often revealed structureless areas, grey globules and areas, irregular black-brown dots, blue and white structures, and red areas.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nIn our experience, early-stage VM often exhibits dermoscopic features that are more typical of thicker cutaneous melanomas.

After initial treatment of HSIL, more than 30% of patients will have disease recurrence, with even higher recurrence among HIV-positive individuals and men who have sex with men. Recurrences can be debilitating and lead to significant morbidity and medical expense. Observational studies suggest a possible therapeutic benefit of the licensed HPV vaccines in reducing recurrent lesions in previously infected persons.\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo test whether the licensed prophylactic HPV vaccine (Gardasil-9) can reduce the risk of HSIL recurrence by 50% in previously unvaccinated individuals recently treated for anal or vulvar HSIL.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:\nThis is a trial protocol for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept clinical trial. Eligible participants are aged 27 to 69 at study start and have not received prior HPV vaccination, have had anal or vulvar HSIL diagnosed on or after January 1, 2014, and have no evidence of HSIL recurrence at screening. Persons infected with HIV are eligible for the study provided they are receiving antiretroviral therapy. Target enrollment is 345 individuals. The primary outcome is time to histopathologically confirmed recurrence of HSIL. Differences in the risk for recurrence of HSIL will be evaluated using Cox proportional hazard models. Additional analyses include (1) frequency of HSIL recurrence; (2) role of HPV antibodies in deterring recurrence; (3) role of HPV persistence in recurrence, as measured by HPV genotype or HPV-16 variant lineage determined using swab samples collected at months 0, 18, and 36; and (4) incidence of adverse events. The study will be conducted at the University of Washington Virology Research Clinic from 2017 through 2022. Participants will be followed up for up to 36 months in the clinic, and up to 42 months by telephone.\nDISCUSSION:\nManagement of persistent or rapidly recurring anogenital HSIL remains challenging.

Data regarding stage, grade, presence of extrauterine disease, receipt of adjuvant radiation, surgical intervention, incidence, and overall survival were extracted. Patients were classified as having early-stage disease (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Stage I/II) or advanced-stage disease (Stage III/IV). Extrauterine disease was defined as either regional or distant metastasis. χ2 Tests, Pearson correlation, and Kaplan-Meier curves were used for statistical analysis.\nRESULTS:\nIn all, 559 cases of gynecologic neuroendocrine tumors were identified during the study period: 242 cervical, 160 ovarian, 118 uterine, and 39 vulvar/vaginal. The majority of patients in all subsets of gynecologic neuroendocrine tumors presented with poorly differentiated tumors, extrauterine disease spread, and advanced-stage disease. Poorly differentiated tumors represented 65.0% of cervical tumors, 45.3% of ovarian tumors, and 57.4% of uterine tumors.

VIN has been classified into two types: usual vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (uVIN), which is also referred to as a vulvar high-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesion (HSIL), and differentiated VIN (dVIN). The former is associated with chronic infection by sub-types of the human papilloma virus (HPV), whereas dVIN is HPV-independent and frequently associated with lichen sclerosus. The distinction is important because dVIN has a greater risk of, and more rapid transit to, vulvar squamous cell carcinoma. Furthermore, dVIN-associated vulvar cancers have an increased risk of recurrence and higher mortality than those arising from HSIL. Molecular characterization of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma precursors using next-generation sequencing is a relatively novel, but rapidly advancing field. This review appraises recent studies that have investigated the risks of progression to vulvar malignancy associated with HSIL and dVIN, the prognosis of HPV-dependent and HPV-independent vulvar squamous cell carcinomas, and conducted next generation sequencing mutation analyses to elucidate the genomic profiles underlying VIN. These studies suggest that HSIL and dVIN are characterized by different underlying molecular alterations that may have important implications for treatment and follow-up of women diagnosed with vulvar squamous cell cancer.\n© IGCS and ESGO 2019.

The current study sheds light on possible cultural influences of the dominant culture on medical students in two developed countries, potentially with different dominant cultures regarding reprogenetics and reproductive risks: Israel and Croatia.\nMETHODS:\nQuantitative-statistical analyses were employed, based on anonymous questionnaires completed by 150 first year medical students in Israel and Croatia.

These questionnaires were completed before the students were engaged in learning about these topics as part of the curriculum in their medical school.\nRESULTS:\nSubstantial differences were revealed between the two groups of medical students. Israeli medical students were less tolerant regarding reproductive risks and more knowledgeable about genetics and reproductive risks than Croatian medical students. For example, while nearly all Israeli medical students (96%) disagreed with the idea that \"Screening for reproductive risks in prospective parents is wrong,\" less than 40% of their Croatian counterparts shared a similar stance. Similarly, all (100%) Israeli medical students correctly observed that \"A carrier of a recessive genetic disease actually has the disease\" was wrong, as opposed to only 82% of Croatian students.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nBy linking applicable theoretical literature to these findings, we suggest that they may reflect the hidden influence of the dominant culture in each country, disguised as part of the \"culture of medicine.\" Acknowledging and learning about such influence of the dominant culture, may be an important addition to the training of medical students in cultural competence, and specifically their cultural awareness. Such an acknowledgement may also pave the road to drawing the attention of existing physicians regarding a less known yet an important aspect of their cultural competence, insofar as the cultural awareness component is concerned."}, {"authors": ["Gao H", "Liu DE", "Li Y", "Tang J", "Wu X", "Tan H"], "topic": "Assisted Reproductive Technology", "title": "Uterine size and volume are associated with higher live birth rate in patients undergoing assisted reproduction technology: A prospective cohort study.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6882568/", "publication": "Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Nov;98(47):e17966. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000017966.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nTo investigate how uterine size and volume are associated with live birth rate in patients undergoing assisted reproduction technology.This prospective cohort study was conducted at the Reproductive Medicine Centre from January 2010 to May 2017.

This article uses a political science concept, the idea of the \"democratic deficit\" to examine the lack of American public discourse on innovations in ART. In doing so, the article focuses on America's missing public consultation in health care innovation. This missing discourse is significant, as political and ethical considerations may impact regulatory decisions. Thus, to the extent that these considerations are influencing the decisions of federal agency employees, namely those who work within the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the public is unable to participate in the decision-making process. This lack of a public discourse undermines the goals of the administrative state, which include democratic participation, transparency, and accountability. The United Kingdom, on the other hand, has had a markedly divergent experience with assisted reproductive technology innovation. Instead of ignoring the various ethical, social, and legal issues surrounding assisted reproductive technology innovation, the United Kingdom engaged in a five-strand public consultation on the topic of mitochondrial transfer, a form of assisted reproductive technology that uses genetic modification in order to prevent disease transmission. This article argues that after a multi-decade standstill in terms of the public discourse related to ethical issues associated with assisted reproductive technology and germline modification, it is time for the United States to institute a more democratic inquiry into the scientific, ethical, and social implications of new forms of assisted reproductive technology and ultimately, forthcoming medical innovations that involve genetic modification."}, {"authors": ["Cai YY", "Lin N", "Zhong LP", "Duan HJ", "Dong YH", "Wu Z", "Su H"], "topic": "Assisted Reproductive Technology", "title": "Serum and follicular fluid thyroid hormone levels and assisted reproductive technology outcomes.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6839061/", "publication": "Reprod Biol Endocrinol. 2019 Nov 7;17(1):90. doi: 10.1186/s12958-019-0529-0.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nOBJECTIVE:\nThe objective ofthis study was to assess the association between thyroid hormone (TH) levels in follicular fluid (FF) and serum and to determine whether THs impact assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcomes.\nMETHODS:\nThis study enrolled 299 women undergoing ART.

The receptor for vitamin D regulates 0.5-5% of the human genome. Accordingly, vitamin D insufficiency has been shown to increase the risk of several diseases.

The present article assesses and compares the incidence of GS in the USA and Israel, two industrialized countries that have maintained active commercial surrogacy practice, for over two decades.\nMETHOD:\nThe article is a secondary analysis of GS figures published by the Israeli Parliament's Centre for Research and Information (2018) and by the USA's Centers for Disease Control (2016) and related professional publications. Each dataset is analyzed in reference to the respective country, so as to devise local incidence scores that are then juxtaposed in inter-country comparison.\nRESULTS:\nThe incidence of GS rises steeply in both countries. Though US surrogates are contracted by local and international, heterosexual and gay, and partnered and single intended parents, the relative incidence of GS is lower in the USA than in Israel, where only local heterosexual couples could contract a gestational surrogate. An exceptionally high rate of multiple births was observed in both settings, suggesting some overlooking of professional recommendations for elective single-embryo transfer.\nCONCLUSION:\nGS incidence appears to resemble the ratio between the countries' respective fertility rates. The paper underscores two main risks facing gestational surrogates: the risk of not conceiving and not being paid and the risk of carrying a multiple pregnancy, which is extremely prevalent in GS pregnancies, and sustaining the short- and long-term health complications that are more prevalent in such pregnancies."}, {"authors": ["Kouhkan A", "Baradaran HR", "Hosseini R", "Arabipoor A", "Moini A", "Pirjani R", "Khajavi A", "Khamseh ME"], "topic": "Assisted Reproductive Technology", "title": "Assisted conception as a potential prognostic factor predicting insulin therapy in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6815419/", "publication": "Reprod Biol Endocrinol. 2019 Oct 27;17(1):83. doi: 10.1186/s12958-019-0525-4.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nAdvanced maternal age, family history of diabetes, pre-gestational obesity, increased level of HbA1c, history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and poor pregnancy consequences are considered risk factors for antenatal insulin requirement in women with GDM.

We aimed at calculating the overall risk of pediatric cancers after ART in a large cohort of exposed women; and to conduct a systematic review and meta- analysis of cohort studies examining overall risk of pediatric cancers after ART.\nMETHODS:\nAll children born in Israel who were members of Maccabi Health Services (MHS) between 1999 and 2016 after ART, were linked to the Israeli Registry of Childhood Cancer (IGS) to identify those with cancer diagnosed before 16 years of age. In parallel we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational cohort studies with more than 5000 ART- exposed cases that measured pediatric cancer after ART.\nRESULTS:\nIn the cohort study, the risk ratio for pediatric cancer after ART in general was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.76-1.19). The RR was 1.09 (95% CI, 0.79-1.48) for IVF treatments. Meta- analysis of 13 cohort studies with a total of 750,138 women exposed to ART (with 1152 pediatric cancers) and 214,008,000 unexposed controls (with 30,458 pediatric cancers) did not reveal increased risk for pediatric cancers (RR 0.99; 95% CI, 0.85-1.15).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nBased on very large numbers, ART in general, and IVF in particular, are not associated with overall increased risk of pediatric cancer.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The primary outcome was proportion of participants undergoing tubal contraceptive procedures within 6 months of delivery. Secondary outcomes included patient satisfaction with the scheduling process, repeat pregnancy rates, and surgical outcomes.

At the active and transition stages of labor, acupressure was applied to the SP6 point of the experimental group, and the SP6 point of the control group was touched each contraction. The data were collected using the Pregnant Information Form. The Partograph Form was used to determine the duration of active stage and transition stage. The labor pain severity was measured using a numeric rating scale (NRS) immediately after each acupressure/touch SP6 in active and transition stages. A participant questionnaire on satisfaction was administered in the immediate postnatal period. The group difference was tested for statistical significance using the Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and the Mann-Whitney U test.\nRESULTS:\nAs the primary outcome, labor pain was less and duration of labor was shorter for the experimental group. As the secondary outcome, satisfaction was increased that could be as a result of reduced pain in labor and/or shorter duration of labor.

We implemented group ANC (G-ANC), an alternative service delivery model, in Kenya and Nigeria, to assess its impact on quality and attendance at ANC and uptake of facility-based delivery.\nMETHODS:\nFrom October 2016‒January 2018, we conducted a facility-based, pragmatic, cluster-randomized controlled trial with 20 clusters per country. We recruited women <24 weeks gestation during their first ANC visit and enrolled women at intervention facilities who agreed to attend G-ANC in lieu of routine individual ANC. The G-ANC model consisted of five monthly 2-hour meetings with clinical assessments alongside structured gestationally specific group discussions and activities. Quality of care was defined as receipt of eight specific ANC interventions. Data were obtained through facility records and self-report during a home-based postpartum survey. Analysis was by intention to treat.\nFINDINGS:\nAll women who completed follow up are included in the analysis (Nigeria: 1018/1075 enrolled women [94.7%], Kenya: 826/1013 [81.5%]).

Inclusion criteria were medical indication for labor induction in pregnant women, ≥37 weeks, with lower segment cesarean section, Bishop score ≤4, no pre-labor rupture of membranes, singleton fetus in cephalic presentation. Women were allocated randomly to induction with a 50-mL balloon catheter for 12 hours or a low-dose oxytocin infusion. Primary outcome was the rate of vaginal birth. Secondary outcomes were maternal and neonatal complications.\nRESULTS:\nThe study enrolled 204 women from 26 December 2010 to 31 December 2013: 101 were allocated to receive balloon catheter and 103 to oxytocin. Vaginal birth rate was 50% (n = 51) in the balloon catheter group vs 37% (n = 38) in the oxytocin group (P = 0.050).

Women with term, singleton pregnancy in vertex position undergoing labour induction for one of the five following indications: prolonged pregnancy, mild hypertensive disorders, diabetes, expected macrosomia, maternal request, were randomised to amniotomy with 12-hours delayed oxytocin (DO), or amniotomy with immediate oxytocin (IO).\nRESULTS:\nA total of 64 women was included in the analysis. The median amniotomy-to-delivery interval for the DO-group was 15 h (IQR 8-21), and 6 h (IQR 5-11) for the IO-group (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.24-0.70), with equal patient reported childbirth perception in the overall group (P=0.43).

A healthy term fetus with a normally developed placenta is able to accommodate this transient hypoxia by activation of the peripheral chemoreflex, resulting in a reduction in oxygen consumption and a centralization of oxygenated blood to critical organs, namely the heart, brain, and adrenals. Providing there is adequate time for placental and fetal reperfusion between contractions, these fetuses will be able to withstand prolonged periods of intermittent hypoxia and avoid severe hypoxic injury. However, there exists a cohort of fetuses in whom abnormal placental development in the first half of pregnancy results in failure of endovascular invasion of the spiral arteries by the cytotrophoblastic cells and inadequate placental angiogenesis. This produces a high-resistance, low-flow circulation predisposing to hypoperfusion, hypoxia, reperfusion injury, and oxidative stress within the placenta. Furthermore, this renders the placenta susceptible to fluctuations and reduction in uteroplacental perfusion in response to external compression and stimuli (as occurs in labor), further reducing fetal capillary perfusion, placing the fetus at risk of inadequate gas/nutrient exchange. This placental dysfunction predisposes the fetus to intrapartum fetal compromise. In the absence of a rare catastrophic event, intrapartum fetal compromise occurs as a gradual process when there is an inability of the fetal heart to respond to the peripheral chemoreflex to maintain cardiac output. This may arise as a consequence of placental dysfunction reducing pre-labor myocardial glycogen stores necessary for anaerobic metabolism or due to an inadequate placental perfusion between contractions to restore fetal oxygen and nutrient exchange. If the hypoxic insult is severe enough and long enough, profound multiorgan injury and even death may occur. This review provides a detailed synopsis of the events that can result in placental dysfunction, how this may predispose to intrapartum fetal hypoxia, and what protective mechanisms are in place to avoid hypoxic injury.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Thirteen distinct isoforms of AQPs have been identified in mammals (AQP0-12). Throughout the male reproductive tract, AQPs greatly enhance water transport across all biological barriers, providing a constant and expeditious movement of water and playing an active role in the regulation of water and ion homeostasis. This regulation of fluids is particularly important in the male reproductive tract, where proper fluid composition is directly linked with a healthy and competent spermatozoa production. For instance, in the testis, fluid regulation is essential for spermatogenesis and posterior spermatozoa transport into the epididymal ducts, while maintaining proper ionic conditions for their maturation and storage. Alterations in the expression pattern of AQPs or their dysfunction is linked with male subfertility/infertility. Thus, AQPs are important for male reproductive health. In this review, we will discuss the most recent data on the expression and function of the AQPs isoforms in the human, mouse and rat male reproductive tract. In addition, the regulation of AQPs expression and dysfunction linked with male infertility will be discussed.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This ethnographic study conducted in The Gambia, West Africa, focuses on how key stakeholders in the country understand infertility, and on their activities to improve the lives of people with infertility.\nMETHODOLOGY:\nThis ethnographic study draws on primary and secondary data for thematic analysis. Primary qualitative data were collected using in-depth interviews, observations, informal conversations and group discussion with various stakeholders (i.e. health care providers and representatives of non-governmental, governmental and international organisations). Sources of secondary data included government and non-governmental reports and media outputs.\nRESULTS:\nResults illustrated that most key stakeholders had a good understanding of the cultural frameworks and social realities of women living with infertility, with less focus on, or awareness of, men's experiences of infertility.

Recruited women will be given the drug (either 600,000 IU of 25(OH) D or placebo in a single oral administration) at the time of randomization. Two centres will participate and the sample size (700 women) is foreseen to be equally distributed between the two. Patients will be treated according to standard IVF protocols.\nDISCUSSION:\nThe primary aim of the study is the cumulative clinical pregnancy rate per oocyte retrieval. Clinical pregnancy is defined as the presence of at least one intrauterine gestational sac with viable foetus at first ultrasound assessment (3 weeks after a positive human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG] assessment). Secondary outcomes include: 1) clinical and embryological variables; 2) oocyte and endometrium quality at a molecular level. To investigate this latter aspect, samples of cumulus cells, follicular and endometrial fluids will be obtained from a subgroup of 50 age-matched good-prognosis cases and controls.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION:\nThe protocol was included in EudraCT on 22nd September 2015 with the registration number assigned ' 2015-004233-27 '; it was submitted through the database of the Italian \"Osservatorio Nazionale della Sperimentazione Clinica (OsSC)\" - (National Monitoring Centre of Clinical Trials) to the National Competent Authority on 8th March 2016 and approved on 23rd June 2016."}, {"authors": ["Torabi M", "Kazemi A", "Abdishahshahani M"], "topic": "Infertility", "title": "Psychometric properties of revised version of the fertility adjustment scale in infertile couples undergoing assisted reproductive technology.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2019.10.006", "publication": "Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol. 2019 Dec;243:16-20. doi: 10.1016/j.ejogrb.2019.10.006.

Individual-level data on pathogenic variants were used to define conditions for PCS based on criteria for severity, penetrance, inheritance pattern, and age of onset.

Exome sequencing achieved remarkable clinical sensitivity for reproductive risk of highly penetrant childhood-onset disorders (1/337 conceptions) through analysis of 114 selected gene-condition pairs. A significant contribution to fetal disease risk was observed for rare (carrier rate < 1:100) and X-linked conditions (16.7% and 41.2% of total FDR, respectively). Subgroup analysis of 776 IVF couples identified 37 at increased reproductive risk (4.8%; 95% CI = 3.4-6.5).

Acellular dermal matrix use with implant-based breast reconstruction has become common because of its perceived superior aesthetic outcome. Matrices are expensive, however, and recent evidence has pointed to several potential complications. This article reports a series of prepectoral implant-based breast reconstructions with and without acellular dermal matrix and compared their outcomes.\nMETHODS:\nThis is a single-surgeon retrospective review of patients who underwent staged prepectoral implant-based breast reconstruction following nipple-sparing mastectomy over two periods. Patients with well-perfused mastectomy skin flaps with a homogeneous thickness underwent reconstruction with acellular dermal matrix initially. On evolution of the practice, it was not used. Patient demographics, operative data, and complications were analyzed. Aesthetic outcome was measured by the BREAST-Q survey and the Aesthetic Item Scale. A cost analysis was also performed.\nRESULTS:\nForty patients were included (acellular dermal matrix group, n = 19; non-acellular dermal matrix group, n = 21). The nonmatrix group had one case (5 percent) of seroma and one case (5 percent) with hematoma; there were none in the acellular dermal matrix group. Average BREAST-Q and Aesthetic Item Scale scores were 82.3 versus 81.6 (p = 0.954) and 20.98 versus 20.43 (p = 0.640) for the matrix and nonmatrix groups, respectively. The direct cost savings for the authors' institution over 1 year if matrix was not used in all cases of implant-based breast reconstruction would be estimated at $3,105,960 to $6,211,920 for unilateral and bilateral cases, respectively, for Medicare reimbursement.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nWith adequate patient selection, acellular dermal matrix is not always required during two-stage prepectoral implant-based breast reconstruction for good aesthetic outcomes.

No consensus regarding a management algorithm for attempted salvage currently exists. This study assessed outcomes of the authors' salvage protocol using an antibiotic-impregnated polymethylmethacrylate implant with expander device exchange.\nMETHODS:\nA retrospective chart review identified infected implant-based breast reconstruction cases treated between 2009 and 2017. Of 626 cases initially identified, a total of 62 cases had severe prosthetic infections, and underwent either prosthetic salvage (n = 45) or immediate explantation (n = 17). All the prosthetic salvage patients received intravenous antibiotics followed by surgical débridement, insertion of polymethylmethacrylate plates, device exchange, and postoperative antibiotics. After clinical resolution of infection, tissue expansion was performed, with the polymethylmethacrylate plates remaining in situ until exchanged for permanent implants.\nRESULTS:\nThe authors' study demonstrated a primary infection clearance rate of 82.2 percent (n = 37). Compared to the traditional explantation group, a significantly higher percentage of the salvage patients completed final reconstruction (84.4 percent versus 35.3 percent; p < 0.001). Fewer patients abandoned reconstruction efforts after infection clearance (2.2 percent versus 58.8 percent; p < 0.001).

Prepectoral direct-to-implant (PDTI) reconstruction with acellular dermal matrix drape and fluorescent imaging (ADFI) was offered to all patients.\nMETHODS:\nThe PDTI with ADFI protocol is (1) fluorescent imaging following mastectomy, (2) acellular dermal matrix prepectoral drape construction, (3) direct-to-implant placement beneath drape, and (4) repeated fluorescent imaging with implant in place.\nRESULTS:\nPatient ages ranged from 29 to 82 years, and body mass index ranged from 19 to 48 kg/m. Implant size ranged from 240 to 800 cc. Two hundred thirty breasts in 131 patients were reconstructed with the PDTI with ADFI protocol between October of 2016 and June of 2018; 32 patients underwent unilateral and 99 underwent bilateral reconstruction. Twelve breasts (5 percent) received postmastectomy radiation therapy after reconstruction. Ten patients (8 percent) had previous lumpectomy and radiation therapy, with local recurrence, and underwent completion mastectomy and PDTI reconstruction with ADFI. Fifteen patients and 22 breasts (9 percent) had subpectoral reconstructions converted to PDTI with ADFI. Ten infections (4 percent) required explantation. Eight breasts (4 percent) were reconstructed with tissue expanders because of poor vascular flow. Seven breasts (3 percent) in five patients received minor cosmetic revision.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nSPY fluorescent imaging and expanded use of acellular dermal matrices has created an environment where PDTI reconstruction can be successful in nearly all postmastectomy patients. Tissue expansion/two-stage reconstruction has evolved to a default approach when vascular supply to skin flaps is compromised.

Despite the low incidence of this new disease, the increasing use of breast implants for cosmetic or post-mastectomy reconstruction purposes places BIA-ALC as an emerging and compelling medical challenge. The real BIA-ALCL pathogenesis has not been fully uncovered so far, while different putative causal factors have been proposed. Breast implants with textured surfaces seem to be associated with nearly all cases of BIA-ALCL, while the real the risk of disease development has not been well estimated so far. Late onset, persistent seroma around breast implant represents the classical clinical presentation. Most of the BIA-ALCL patients presents with localized disease, which confers an excellent prognosis. Unlike other non-Hodgkin lymphomas, surgical excision of the mass has a key role in the treatment. For patients with advanced and disseminated diseases, the treatment did not differ from other types of T-cell lymphoma. For these reasons, BIA-ALCL represents an emerging disease which requires multidisciplinary team approach to well define diagnostic workup and treatment for each patient. This review article aims to summarize available data on BIA-ALCL. First, we will outline available data on BIA-ALCL epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnostic work-up, and treatment. Second, we will point out the potential psychological implications as well as the risk of perception distortion for women with breast implants, especially for those with previous breast cancer. Lastly, we will summarize the current national recommendations regarding textured breast implants and discuss the diagnostic-therapeutic algorithm for BIA-ALCL management.\nCopyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Endoscopic technique did not have wide diffusion; many centers have abandoned this technique because of technical challenges. Implant-based reconstruction (IBR) remains the most common form of breast reconstruction. Current techniques involve partial or total coverage of the implant with pectoralis major muscle to prevent exposure or infection. Muscle dissection has functional and cosmetic consequences. CASE REPORT We present a case of 45-year-old patient presenting with personal history of right breast cancer. The patient requested left prophylactic mastectomy. We used a 4 cm-long single hidden scar on axillary line. Endoscopic nipple-sparing mastectomy was done using a single port with 3 sleeves. Immediate breast reconstruction was performed by inserting a silicon implant in prepectoral plane without Acellular Dermal Matrix (ADM).

Since their introduction, they have been considered to be nonreactive and nonimmunogenic scaffolds. However, some patients who undergo implant-based breast reconstruction with acellular dermal matrices develop postoperative cutaneous erythema overlying their matrices, a condition commonly referred to as red breast syndrome. The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of this phenomenon. An analysis was conducted on consecutive patients who underwent acellular dermal matrix- and implant-based breast reconstructions and developed red breast syndrome that was treated surgically between April of 2017 and June of 2018 at the authors' institution. During surgery, 1-cm specimens of acellular dermal matrix were sampled and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Observations were charted to score and record the presence and thickness of biofilm, and for identification of bacteria. These measurements were performed using Adobe Photoshop CS6 Extended software. Six postmastectomy breast reconstruction patients were included, all with AlloDerm Ready-to-Use-based reconstructions. All specimens were colonized by various bacteria ranging from Gram-negative bacilli to Gram-positive microorganisms. Biofilm was present in all studied specimens. The cause of skin erythema overlying acellular dermal matrix grafts, and the so-called red breast syndrome, may be related to contamination with various bacteria. Although contamination was omnipresent in analyzed samples, its clinical significance is variable. Even if acellular dermal matrix-based reconstructions are salvaged, this could come at the price of chronic local inflammation."}, {"authors": ["Nelson JA", "Voineskos SH", "Qi J", "Kim HM", "Hamill JB", "Wilkins EG", "Pusic AL"], "topic": "Breast Reconstruction", "title": "Elective Revisions after Breast Reconstruction: Results from the Mastectomy Reconstruction Outcomes Consortium.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6934401/", "publication": "Plast Reconstr Surg. 2019 Dec;144(6):1280-1290. doi: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000006225.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nRates of breast reconstruction following mastectomy continue to increase. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of elective revision surgery and the number of procedures required to achieve a stable breast reconstruction 2 years after mastectomy.\nMETHODS:\nWomen undergoing first-time breast reconstruction after mastectomy were enrolled and followed for 2 years, with completion of reconstruction occurring in 1996.

It is believed to be safe, despite a slightly increased complication rate. Although never established in a unifying study, the primary advantage of acellular dermal matrix is believed to be an enhanced aesthetic result, thus justifying the added expense. The purpose of this study was to assess the aesthetic benefits of acellular dermal matrix in expander-to-implant breast reconstruction.\nMETHODS:\nA systematic review adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methodology was performed including all original studies examining aesthetic outcomes of expander-to-implant breast reconstructions with acellular dermal matrix compared to muscular coverage. Direct-to-implant and prepectoral studies were excluded from the evaluation. The results were aggregated and reported as a summary.\nRESULTS:\nAmong 883 studies identified, 49 full-text articles were reviewed and nine articles ultimately met inclusion criteria. All nine studies were not randomized. Of these, three articles (1448 total patients) evaluated reconstruction aesthetic outcomes by patient satisfaction, whereas six articles evaluated the aesthetic outcomes by external observer (504 total patients). None of the articles evaluating patient satisfaction reported a difference between acellular dermal matrix and muscular reconstruction. Five of the six articles using objective outcomes demonstrated significant improvement in aesthetic outcome in the acellular dermal matrix group.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nAlthough little evidence exists evaluating the aesthetic benefits of acellular dermal matrix for expander-to-implant breast reconstruction, the data suggest that objective observers consider acellular dermal matrix-assisted expander-to-implant breast reconstructions aesthetically superior to reconstruction with only muscular coverage, but patients appear to be equally satisfied with both reconstructive options."}, {"authors": ["Tuohy JF", "Bloomfield FH", "Harding JE", "Crowther CA"], "topic": "Diabetes and Pregnancy", "title": "Patterns of antenatal corticosteroid administration in a cohort of women with diabetes in pregnancy.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7046227/", "publication": "PLoS One. 2020 Feb 27;15(2):e0229014. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0229014. eCollection 2020.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nAntenatal corticosteroids administered to the mother prior to birth decrease the risk of mortality and major morbidity in infants born at less than 35 weeks' gestation.

This study is a retrospective review of antenatal corticosteroid administration at a New Zealand tertiary hospital in women with diabetes in pregnancy. We found that in this cohort, for both an initial course at less than 35 weeks' gestation and repeat courses at less than 33 weeks', the administration of antenatal corticosteroid to women with diabetes in pregnancy is largely consistent with current Australian and New Zealand recommendations. However, almost 25% of women received their last dose of antenatal corticosteroid at or beyond the latest recommended gestation of 35 weeks' gestation. Pre-existing diabetes and planned caesarean section were independently associated with an increased rate of antenatal corticosteroid administration. We conclude that diabetes in pregnancy does not appear to be a deterrent to antenatal corticosteroid administration.

We used a family-based design to assess the association between CTDs and the maternal genotype for individual hypertension, T2D, and obesity-related SNPs and found no association between CTDs and the maternal genotype for any individual SNP. In addition, we calculated genetic risk scores (GRS) for hypertension, T2D, and obesity using previously published GRS formulas. When comparing the GRS of mothers to fathers, there were no statistically significant differences in the mean for the combined GRS or the GRS for each individual condition. However, when we categorized the mothers and fathers of cases with CTDs as having high (>95th percentile) or low (≤95th percentile) scores, compared to fathers, mothers had almost two times the odds of having a high GRS for hypertension (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0, 2.8) and T2D (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1, 3.1).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nOur results support a link between maternal genetic risk for hypertension/T2D and CTDs in their offspring.

Antenatal glycaemia was assessed at 12, 24 and 34 weeks gestation. Intrapartum glycaemia was assessed by continuous glucose monitoring measures 24 hours prior to delivery. The primary outcome was neonatal hypoglycaemia defined as glucose concentration < 2.6 mmol/l and requiring intravenous dextrose.\nRESULTS:\nNeonatal hypoglycaemia occurred in 57/225 (25.3%) infants, 21 (15%) term and 36 (40%) preterm neonates. During the second and third trimesters, mothers of infants with neonatal hypoglycaemia had higher HbA1c [48 ± 7 (6.6 ± 0.6) vs. 45 ± 7 (6.2 ± 0.6); P = 0.0009 and 50 ± 7 (6.7 ± 0.6) vs. 46 ± 7 (6.3 ± 0.6); P = 0.0001] and lower continuous glucose monitoring time-in-range (46% vs. 53%; P = 0.004 and 60% vs. 66%; P = 0.03).

While more intrapartum continuous glucose monitoring data are needed, the higher birthweight and skinfold measures associated with neonatal hypoglycaemia suggest that risk is related to fetal hyperinsulinemia preceding the immediate intrapartum period.\n© 2019 Diabetes UK."}, {"authors": ["Alexopoulos AS", "Blair R", "Peters AL"], "topic": "Diabetes and Pregnancy", "title": "Management of Preexisting Diabetes in Pregnancy: A Review.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6657017/", "publication": "JAMA. 2019 May 14;321(18):1811-1819. doi: 10.1001/jama.2019.4981.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nIMPORTANCE:\nThe presence of preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes in pregnancy increases the risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, such as preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, preterm delivery, macrosomia, and congenital defects. Approximately 0.9% of the 4 million births in the United States annually are complicated by preexisting diabetes.\nOBSERVATIONS:\nWomen with diabetes have increased risk for adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, and similar risks are present with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Both forms of diabetes require similar intensity of diabetes care. Preconception planning is very important to avoid unintended pregnancies and to minimize risk of congenital defects. Hemoglobin A1c goals are less than 6.5% at conception and less than 6.0% during pregnancy. It is also critical to screen for and manage comorbid illnesses, such as retinopathy and nephropathy. Medications known to be unsafe in pregnancy, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins, should be discontinued. Women with obesity should be screened for obstructive sleep apnea, which is often undiagnosed and can result in poor outcomes. Blood pressure goals must be considered carefully because lower treatment thresholds may be required for women with nephropathy. During pregnancy, continuous glucose monitoring can improve glycemic control and neonatal outcomes in women with type 1 diabetes. Insulin is first-line therapy for all women with preexisting diabetes; injections and insulin pump therapy are both effective approaches. Rates of severe hypoglycemia are increased during pregnancy; therefore, glucagon should be available to the patient and close contacts should be trained in its use. Low-dose aspirin is recommended soon after 12 weeks' gestation to minimize the risk of preeclampsia. The importance of discussing long-acting reversible contraception before and after pregnancy, to allow for appropriate preconception planning, cannot be overstated.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:\nPreexisting diabetes in pregnancy is complex and is associated with significant maternal and neonatal risk.

Our aim was to examine the safety, efficacy, and longer-term feasibility of day-and-night closed-loop insulin delivery.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:\nWe recruited 16 pregnant women (mean [SD]: age 32.8 [5.0] years, T1D duration 19.4 [10.2] years, HbA1c 8.0% [1.1], and BMI 26.6 [4.4] kg/m2) to an open-label, randomized, crossover trial. Participants completed 28 days of closed-loop and sensor-augmented pump (SAP) insulin delivery separated by a washout period. Afterward, participants could continue to use the closed-loop system up to 6 weeks postpartum. The primary end point was the proportion of time with glucose levels within the target range (63-140 mg/dL).\nRESULTS:\nThe proportion of time with glucose levels within target was comparable during closed-loop and SAP insulin delivery (62.3 vs. 60.1% [95% CI -4.1 to 8.3]; P = 0.47). Mean glucose and time spent hyperglycemic >140 mg/dL also did not differ (131.4 vs. 131.4 mg/dL [P = 0.85] and 36.6 vs. 36.1% [P = 0.86], respectively). During closed-loop, fewer hypoglycemic episodes occurred (median 8 [range 1-17] vs. 12.5 [1-53] over 28 days; P = 0.04) and less time at <63 mg/dL (1.6 vs. 2.7%; P = 0.02). Hypoglycemia <50 mg/dL (0.24 vs. 0.47%; P = 0.03) and low blood glucose index (1.0 vs. 1.4; P = 0.01) were lower. Less nocturnal hypoglycemia (2300-0700 h) during closed-loop therapy (1.1 vs. 2.7%; P = 0.008) and a trend toward higher overnight time in target (67.7 vs. 60.6%; P = 0.06) were found.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nClosed-loop insulin delivery was associated with comparable glucose control and significantly less hypoglycemia than SAP therapy.

Current clinical guidelines support elective birth, at or near term, because of increased perinatal mortality during the third trimester of pregnancy.This review replaces a review previously published in 2001 that included \"diabetic pregnant women\", which has now been split into two reviews. This current review focuses on pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2) and a sister review focuses on women with gestational diabetes.\nOBJECTIVES:\nTo assess the effect of planned birth (either by induction of labour or caesarean birth) at or near term gestation (37 to 40 weeks' gestation) compared with an expectant approach, for improving health outcomes for pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes and their infants.

All these genital changes taken together are of major importance in facilitating the possibility of reproductive success (and thus gene propagation) no matter how or when the clitoris is stimulated-they reveal its overlooked reproductive function.

Despite extensive studies aimed at elucidating the physical effects of hormonal contraceptives and ameliorating some unwanted outcomes, little is known yet about the effects of these drugs on brain function and related behavior, which are known to be modulated by endogenous steroid hormones. We describe the current literature on preclinical studies in animals undertaken to investigate effects of hormonal contraceptives on brain function and behavior. These studies suggest that hormonal contraceptives influence neurohormones, neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and emotional, cognitive, social and sexual behaviors. Animals allow examination of the basic biological mechanisms of these drugs, devoid of the psychological aspect often associated to hormonal contraceptives' use in women. Understanding the neurobiological effects of these drugs may improve women's health and may help women making informed choices on hormonal contraception.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We used a stratified random sampling method to recruit 600 FEWs for face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire.

Political initiatives aimed at prohibiting the affirmation of sexual and reproductive rights, while also curtailing debate about sexuality and gender in schools and universities, have raised \"moral panic\" within some elements of Brazilian society. The discursive strategies used around so-called \"gender ideology\" stimulated the formation of civil organisations which promote morality based on right-wing political positions. For this study, we looked at official documents and bibliographic material to examine how issues related to abortion rights, health care in cases of sexual violence, the prevention of sexually transmitted infections and homosexual citizenship are currently being suppressed, compromising the defence and advancement of the sexual and reproductive rights of women and the LGBTI+ population. The results point to the steady weakening of public policies that had become law in the 1980s, a time of Brazilian re-democratisation after two decades of military dictatorship. A wide range of civil, political and social rights, which saw significant growth and consolidation over the last 20 years, were rolled back after the resurgence of the extreme right wing in the federal legislature, culminating in the election of the current president in October 2018.

To understand areas for prioritising HIV prevention intervention efforts, we explored the prevalence and correlates of partner violence among out of school AGYW in Shinyanga, Tanzania.\nMETHODS:\nA cross-sectional analysis of data from AGYW aged 15-23 years recruited in a cluster randomised trial conducted between October and December 2017 was used to examine correlates of partner violence. Data were collected through an Audio Computer-Assisted Self-interview. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association.\nRESULTS:\n2276 (75.5%) AGYW were sexually active. Of these, 816 (35.9%) reported having experienced violence from partners in the last six months. After adjusting for other covariates, being formerly married (AOR = 1.55, 95% CI:1.02, 2.37), having children (AOR = 1.79, 95% CI:1.47, 2.16), anxiety and depression symptoms (AOR = 3.27, 95%CI: 2.15, 4.96), having engaged in sex work in the past six months (AOR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.45, 2.53) and economic deprivation (AOR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.34,1.92) were significantly associated with partner violence.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nAlmost one in three sexually active AGYW had experienced partner violence in the 6 months preceding the survey. The findings underscore the need for future research to focus on understanding the reasons and dynamics underlying high level of partner violence among AGYW. Furthermore, there is a need for implementing intervention programs that aim to reduce economic deprivation among AGYWs and address social norms and structures perpetuating violence against AGYW.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION:\nClinicalTrials.gov-ID NCT03597243."}, {"authors": ["Blecher GA", "Christopher N", "Ralph DJ"], "topic": "Sexual Health", "title": "Prosthetic Placement After Phalloplasty.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ucl.2019.07.013", "publication": "Urol Clin North Am. 2019 Nov;46(4):591-603. doi: 10.1016/j.ucl.2019.07.013.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nSignificant developments have enabled the transformation of phalloplasty to a functional organ.

In the trial, participants were randomly allocated to receive a text message with the web link of an e-STI testing and results service (intervention group) or a text message with the link of a website listing the locations, contact details and websites of seven local sexual health clinics (control group). We analysed a subsample of 528 trial participants who reported never testing for STIs at baseline. Outcomes were self-reported STI testing at 6 weeks, verified by patient record checks, and time from randomisation to completion of an STI test.\nRESULTS:\nUptake of STI testing among 'never testers' almost doubled. At 6 weeks, 45.3% of the intervention completed at least one test (chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and HIV), compared with 24.1% of the control (relative risk [RR] 1.88, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.40, p<0.001). For chlamydia and gonorrhoea testing combined, uptake was 44.3% in the intervention versus 24.1% in controls (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.36, p<0.001). The intervention reduced time to any STI test (restricted mean survival time: 29.0 days vs 36.3 days, p<0.001) at a time horizon of 42 days.

Incremental cost-effective ratios for each strategy were calculated, and a ratio of $100,000 per QALY was used to define cost effectiveness. One-way sensitivity analyses and a Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed.\nRESULTS:\nUnder base assumptions, initiation of buprenorphine was more effective at a lower cost than either methadone or detoxification and thus was the dominant strategy. Buprenorphine was no longer cost effective if the cost of methadone was 8% less than the base-case estimate ($1,646/month) or if the overall costs of detoxification were 121% less than the base-case estimate for the detoxification cost multiplier, which was used to increase the values of both inpatient and outpatient management of detoxification by a factor of 2. Monte Carlo analyses revealed that buprenorphine was the cost-effective strategy in 70.5% of the simulations. Direct comparison of buprenorphine with methadone demonstrated that buprenorphine was below the incremental cost-effective ratio in 95.1% of simulations; direct comparison between buprenorphine and detoxification demonstrated that buprenorphine was below the incremental cost-effective ratio in 45% of simulations.\nCONCLUSION:\nUnder most circumstances, we estimate that buprenorphine is the cost-effective strategy when compared with either methadone or detoxification as treatment for OUD during pregnancy.

Methadone and buprenorphine are opioid agonist drugs. Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, is also a medication-assisted treatment option; however, to date, only a few retrospective studies have reported its use in pregnancy.\nOBJECTIVE:\nOur study objective was to evaluate prospectively obstetric and newborn outcomes and the maternal/fetal effects of the use of naltrexone as a medication-assisted treatment in pregnant patients with opioid use disorder.\nSTUDY DESIGN:\nWe performed a prospective cohort study collecting data on all pregnant women who were treated with naltrexone medication-assisted treatment compared with pregnant women who were treated with methadone or buprenorphine medication-assisted treatment. Based on a sample size calculation, it was determined that for a power of 90, a minimum of 160 study participants (80 in each group) was needed with an alpha of .01 and an expected 60% rate of newborn infants who were treated for neonatal abstinence syndrome in the methadone or buprenorphine medication-assisted treatment group compared with a 30% rate in the naltrexone medication-assisted treatment group. In a random subset of 20 maternal/newborn dyads, blood levels for naltrexone and 6-beta-naltrexol (an active metabolite) were analyzed at delivery.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 230 patients were studied: 121 patients with naltrexone medication-assisted treatment compared with 109 patients with methadone or buprenorphine medication-assisted treatment. No differences between groups were seen regarding demographics, the use of comedications/drugs, or obstetric outcomes. For newborn outcomes, the rate of neonatal abstinence syndrome in neonates >34 weeks gestation was significantly lower in the naltrexone medication-assisted treatment group (10/119 [8.4%] vs 79/105 [75.2%]; P<.0001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the only significant factor for the rate of neonatal abstinence syndrome was the form of medication-assisted treatment. Of 87 patients who received naltrexone up to delivery, no neonates experienced symptoms of neonatal abstinence syndrome. No maternal relapses occurred in the 7-day no-treatment window before the initiation of naltrexone therapy. No cases of spontaneous abortion or stillbirth occurred in either group. In 64 patients who started naltrexone therapy at ≥24 weeks gestation, no changes were seen in the fetal heart monitor tracing with drug initiation. The incidence of birth anomalies was no different between the groups. Umbilical cord blood and maternal levels for naltrexone and 6-beta-naltrexol matched; no levels were elevated, and values were undetected if naltrexone was discontinued >60 hours before delivery.\nCONCLUSION:\nThese study data demonstrate that, in pregnant women who choose to completely detoxify off opioid drugs during gestation, naltrexone, as a continued form of medication-assisted treatment, is a viable option for some pregnant patients who experience opioid use disorder. Naltrexone crosses the placenta, and maternal and fetal levels are concordant. Because naltrexone clears quickly from the maternal circulation, this rapid clearance needs to be addressed with patients. This is important because maternal relapse could occur in a short time-period if the oral drug is discontinued without the knowledge of their healthcare providers. Nonetheless, the drug is well-tolerated by both mother and fetus, and newborn infants do not experience symptoms of neonatal abstinence syndrome if naltrexone medication-assisted treatment is maintained to delivery.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Medication-assisted treatment during pregnancy provides benefits to the mother and fetus, including better pregnancy outcomes, reduced illicit drug use, and improved prenatal care. An alternative approach, medically supervised withdrawal (detoxification), has, in recent reports, demonstrated a low risk of fetal death and low rates of relapse and neonatal abstinence syndrome. The rates of relapse and neonatal abstinence syndrome are questioned by many who view medically supervised withdrawal as unacceptable based on the concern for the potential adverse consequences of relapse to mother and baby. The impact of opioids on the fetal brain have not been integrated into this debate. Studies in animals and human brain tissues demonstrate opioid receptors in neurons, astroglia, and oligodendrocytes. Age-specific normative data from infants, children, and adults have facilitated investigation of the impact of opioids on the human brain in vivo. Collectively, these studies in animals, human neural tissue, adult brains, and the brains of children and newborns demonstrate that opioids adversely affect the human brain, primarily the developing oligodendrocyte and the processes of myelinization (white matter microstructure), connectivity between parts of the brain, and the size of multiple brain regions, including the basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellar white matter. These in vivo studies across the human lifespan suggest vulnerability of specific fronto-temporal-limbic and frontal-subcortical (basal ganglia and cerebellum) pathways that are also likely vulnerable in the human fetal brain. The long-term impact of these reproducible changes in the fetal brain in vivo is unclear, but the possibility of lasting injury has been suggested. In light of the recent data on medically supervised withdrawal and the emerging evidence suggesting adverse effects of opioids on the developing fetal brain, a new paradigm of care is needed that includes the preferred option of medication-assisted treatment but also the option of medically supervised opioid withdrawal for a select group of women. Both these treatment options should offer mental health and social services support throughout pregnancy. More research on both opioid exposure on the developing human brain and the impact of medically supervised withdrawal is required to identify appropriate candidates, optimal dose reduction regimens, and gestational age timing for initiating medically supervised withdrawal.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Previous reports suggested an association between methadone exposure and Pierre Robin sequence (PRS), a rare craniofacial anomaly. We assessed the association between gestational methadone exposure and PRS.\nDESIGN/SETTING:\nThis case-malformed control study used European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies population-based registries in Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, Croatia, Malta, Portugal, Germany, Wales, Norway and Spain, 1995-2011.\nPATIENTS:\nCases included PRS based on International Classification of Disease (ICD), Ninth Edition-British Paediatric Association (BPA) code 75 603 or ICD, Tenth Edition-BPA code Q8708. Malformed controls were all non-PRS anomalies, excluding genetic conditions, among live births, fetal deaths from 20 weeks' gestation and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomalies. An exploratory analysis assessed the association between methadone exposure and other congenital anomalies (CAs) excluding PRS. Methadone exposure was ascertained from medical records and maternal interview.\nRESULTS:\nAmong 87 979 CA registrations, there were 127 methadone-exposed pregnancies and 336 PRS cases. There was an association between methadone exposure and PRS (OR adjusted for registry 12.3, 95% CI 5.7 to 26.8). In absolute terms, this association reflects a risk increase from approximately 1-12 cases per 10 000 births. A raised OR was found for cleft palate (adjusted OR 5.0, 95% CI 2.7 to 9.2).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThese findings suggest that gestational methadone exposure is associated with PRS. The association may be explained by unmeasured confounding factors. The small increased risk of PRS in itself does not alter the risk-benefit balance for gestational methadone use. The association with cleft palate, a more common CA, should be assessed with independent data.\n© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

The true extent of the problem is unknown and there is a need for better screening. Existing guidelines with respect to the management of pregnant women with opioid use are based on limited evidence. To improve recommendations for optimal identification, management, and treatment, publications on opioids in pregnancy were reviewed. Published literature from 2007 to 2017 was searched in PubMed, Cochrane and Embase databases. The review employed 60 publications from 210 studies identified, that were of varying quality and included randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and Cochrane reviews. The prevalence of opioid use in pregnancy is underestimated. Screening by urine testing and self-reporting is acceptable to identify fetal exposure. To minimize risk, opioid agonist pharmacotherapy should replace the continued use of opioids or detoxification. Current guidelines recommend methadone and buprenorphine equally. However, recent studies indicate that buprenorphine has advantages over methadone. Accordingly, we suggest buprenorphine as first-line therapy. Future studies should elaborate on better objective screening methods to prevent the consequences of fetomaternal opioid exposure.\n© 2019 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology."}, {"authors": ["Lazenby GB", "Orr C", "Guille C", "Meissner EG"], "topic": "Pregnancy and Opioids", "title": "Increasing Prevalence of Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection in a Southern Academic Obstetrical Clinic.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6956563/", "publication": "South Med J. 2019 Jun;112(6):325-330. doi: 10.14423/SMJ.0000000000000988.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nOBJECTIVES:\nThe opioid epidemic has resulted in rising rates of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in women of childbearing age. With this changing epidemiology in mind, the Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines were updated in 2018 to recommend screening all pregnant women for HCV infection, irrespective of risk factors.

Incremental cost-effective ratios for each strategy were calculated, and a ratio of $100,000 per QALY was used to define cost effectiveness. One-way sensitivity analyses and a Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed.\nRESULTS:\nUnder base assumptions, initiation of buprenorphine was more effective at a lower cost than either methadone or detoxification and thus was the dominant strategy. Buprenorphine was no longer cost effective if the cost of methadone was 8% less than the base-case estimate ($1,646/month) or if the overall costs of detoxification were 121% less than the base-case estimate for the detoxification cost multiplier, which was used to increase the values of both inpatient and outpatient management of detoxification by a factor of 2. Monte Carlo analyses revealed that buprenorphine was the cost-effective strategy in 70.5% of the simulations. Direct comparison of buprenorphine with methadone demonstrated that buprenorphine was below the incremental cost-effective ratio in 95.1% of simulations; direct comparison between buprenorphine and detoxification demonstrated that buprenorphine was below the incremental cost-effective ratio in 45% of simulations.\nCONCLUSION:\nUnder most circumstances, we estimate that buprenorphine is the cost-effective strategy when compared with either methadone or detoxification as treatment for OUD during pregnancy.

Risk of opioid use decreased by 26% among women who delivered vaginally (risk ratio [RR] 0.74; 95% CI [0.68, 0.81]) and 18% among women who delivered by cesarean (RR 0.82; 95% CI [0.72, 0.92]). Among women who received opioids, mean MME use decreased 21% (RR 0.79; 95% CI [0.70, 0.88]) and 54% (RR 0.46; 95% CI [0.35, 0.61]) in the vaginal and cesarean delivery groups, respectively. Fewer women reported acceptable pain levels, with decreases of 82-69% (P<.01) and 82-74% (P<.01) in the vaginal and cesarean delivery groups, respectively. Within the postlaunch cesarean delivery group, women also reported that they were less likely to have their pain well controlled on the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems questionnaires (82% vs 62%, P <.01).\nCONCLUSION:\nA standardized multimodal pain power plan reduced opioid use among a large cohort of women admitted to labor and delivery in Central Texas.

The overall prevalence of prenatal cannabis use varied substantially (min-max: 0.24-22.6%), with the greatest use in the first trimester. In the three studies with temporal data available, rates of prenatal cannabis use increased across years. Only 7/41 and 5/41 studies provided information on gestational age of exposure and frequency of use, respectively. The concomitant use of alcohol, illicit drugs, and tobacco was higher among cannabis users than nonusers. Prenatal cannabis use was associated with select neonatal, but not maternal, health outcomes.

Our aim was to further explore and characterise perceived threats, benefits and barriers of e-cigarette use during pregnancy.\nMETHODS:\nOur STudy on E-cigarettes and Pregnancy (STEP) was, among others, based on a netnographic approach of analysing existing threads in German-speaking online discussion forums dealing with perceived threats and benefits of e-cigarette use during pregnancy. For the analysis, we used an inductive-deductive qualitative content analysis.\nFINDINGS:\nBased on 25 online discussion threads containing 1552 posts, we identified perceived threats, perceived benefits and perceived barriers to e-cigarette use during pregnancy, among others, as main themes. Subthemes identified within the main theme perceived threats were severe nicotine related health risks, potential health risks of additional ingredients, relative risks and lack of knowledge and research studies. As perceived benefits, we identified possibility and facilitation of smoking cessation, harm reduction and financial benefits. Perceived barriers were lack of satisfaction and social stigma.\nCONCLUSION:\nOur qualitative results suggest that the perception of the health threats related to e-cigarette use during pregnancy varies according to the nicotine content and the perception of relative risks compared with tobacco cigarettes. In addition to this, risk perception is defined through further health and non-health related barriers and benefits (e.g. suitability of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid, social stigma).\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In recent years epidemiological studies indicate the deterioration of semen parameters: reduction of ejaculate volume, sperm count, and mobility, as well as abnormalities in their morphology. Male infertility can result from many different agents, such as: anatomical or genetic abnormalities, systemic or neurological diseases, infections, trauma, iatrogenic injury, gonadotoxins and development of sperm antibodies and lifestyle (especially obesity, heat and tobacco smoking). It is well documented that adverse changes in male fertility also seem to be associated with environmental exposure to different substances, especially endocrine active factors, known as xenoestrogens, and among these metal ions, known as metalloestrogens, are very important. The role of some metalloestrogens in various diseases, both in women and men, is known and particularly well-proven in women, but still little is known about their role in the regulation of male reproductive potential. Thus we decided to analyse the available information exploring this problem. The review was carried out using the Medline and Google Scholar databases, using the keywords: xenoestrogens, metalloestrogens, male fertility, semen quality, male reproductive potential, mechanisms of metalloestrogen action, environmental pollution and the name of the particular metal.

These changes in serum testosterone were not associated with any significant changes in serum gonadotrophins. The nadir in serum testosterone preceded the post-prandial increase in serum IL-6/IL-17 by several hours, suggesting that inflammation was unlikely the cause. Furthermore, intravenous administration of fat (Intralipid) had no impact on testosterone levels, while an identical oral dose of fat did suppress testosterone.

It has only been with technological advances over the past few years that physicians and computer scientists have started discovering its true clinical potential. Reproductive urology is a sub-discipline that AI could be of great contribution, as current predictive models and subjectivity within the field have several limitations. We review the literature to summarize recent AI applications in reproductive urology.\nRECENT FINDINGS:\nEarly AI applications in reproductive urology focused on predicting semen parameters based on questionnaires that identify potential environmental factors and/or lifestyle habits impacting male fertility. AI has shown success in predicting the patient subpopulation most likely to need a genetic workup for azoospermia. With recent advances in image processing, automated sperm detection is a reality. Semen analyses, once a laboratory-only diagnostic test, have moved into health consumer homes with the advent of AI. AI's prospects in medicine are considerable and there is strong potential for AI within reproductive urology. Research in identifying the factors that can affect reproductive success either naturally or with assisted reproduction is of paramount importance to move the field forward."}, {"authors": ["Balafoutas D", "Joukhadar R", "Kiesel M", "Häusler S", "Loeb S", "Woeckel A", "Herr D"], "topic": "Reproductive Hazards", "title": "The Role of Deconstructive Teaching in the Training of Laparoscopy.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6600054/", "publication": "JSLS. 2019 Apr-Jun;23(2). pii: e2019.00020. doi: 10.4293/JSLS.2019.00020.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:\nSkills-lab training is crucial for the development of advanced laparoscopic skills.

Regarding the impact of IR on spermatogenesis, spermatogonia are less susceptible to the occurrence of DNA damage after exposition to IR, but are characterized by slower DNA repair compared to somatic cells. Damage to the genes after exposure to IR is possible at each stage of spermatogenesis; however, haploidal spermatids show the highest radiosensitivity in this respect. The genetic risk of the cells differentiating during spermatogenesis is limited to one cycle of spermatogenesis, whereas the genetic instability may persist for the whole period of life, and DNA damage induced by IR may be transmitted to future generations. The minimum dose causing detectable DNA damage was 30 Gy. While exceeding this dose, the number of single-strand DNA breaks increases. Among males exposed to IR, a decrease was observed in sperm motility and in the percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa as well as in an intensification of vacuolization. The genetic material in the sperm of these males showed higher fragmentation and methylation of genomic DNA.\nCONCLUSION:\nIn the context of the epidemiological situation concerning the prevalence of infertility, while assessing the health effects of exposure to IR from artificial, including medical sources, the reproductive risk should be considered."}, {"authors": ["Bernardino RL", "Carrageta DF", "Sousa M", "Alves MG", "Oliveira PF"], "topic": "Reproductive Hazards", "title": "pH and male fertility: making sense on pH homeodynamics throughout the male reproductive tract.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-019-03170-w", "publication": "Cell Mol Life Sci. 2019 Oct;76(19):3783-3800. doi: 10.1007/s00018-019-03170-w.

Among the several ions, HCO3- and H+ have a central role, mainly due to their role on pH homeostasis. In the male reproductive tract, the major players in pH regulation and homeodynamics are carbonic anhydrases (CAs), HCO3- membrane transporters (solute carrier 4-SLC4 and solute carrier 26-SLC26 family transporters), Na+-H+ exchangers (NHEs), monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) and voltage-gated proton channels (Hv1). CAs and these membrane transporters are widely distributed throughout the male reproductive tract, where they play essential roles in the ionic balance of tubular fluids. CAs are the enzymes responsible for the production of HCO3- which is then transported by membrane transporters to ensure the maturation, storage, and capacitation of the spermatozoa. The transport of H+ is carried out by NHEs, Hv1, and MCTs and is essential for the electrochemical balance and for the maintenance of the pH within the physiological limits along the male reproductive tract. Alterations in HCO3- production and transport of ions have been associated with some male reproductive dysfunctions. Herein, we present an up-to-date review on the distribution and role of the main intervenient on pH homeodynamics in the fluids throughout the male reproductive tract.

We aimed to understand knowledge of the abortion law and attitudes towards abortion amongst health care providers' and abortion experts in Zimbabwe as these can hinder access to safe legal abortion.\nMETHODS:\nIn 2016, we conducted a Health Facility Survey (HFS) (n=227) among health care providers' knowledgeable about abortion services in their facility in a census of facilities offering Post Abortion Care (PAC), and a Health Professionals Survey (HPS) among 118 abortion experts.\nRESULTS:\nTwenty-five percent of providers and 47% of experts knew all four reasons under which abortion is legal in Zimbabwe. Amongst providers and experts, 31% and 50% respectively were misinformed about one or more legal criteria. Most providers and experts were in support of expanding the legal provision of abortion to cases when the woman's mental health is at risk (65% and 79%, respectively) and if the woman is mentally incapacitated (66% amongst all). Seventy-one percent of experts recommend liberalizing the abortion law in order to reduce unsafe abortions.\nCONCLUSION:\nThere is incomplete and sometimes inaccurate knowledge on the legal provisions for performing abortions in Zimbabwe amongst both health care providers and abortion experts. Incomplete knowledge of the law may be further reducing abortion access, highlighting the urgent need for educating health care providers on the legal status of abortion.\n© Mugove Gerald Madziyire et al."}, {"authors": ["Dineley B", "Munro S", "Norman WV"], "topic": "Abortion", "title": "Leadership for success in transforming medical abortion policy in Canada.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6948737/", "publication": "PLoS One. 2020 Jan 8;15(1):e0227216. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0227216. eCollection 2020.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nOBJECTIVES:\nMifepristone was approved for use in medical abortion by Health Canada in 2015. Approval was accompanied by regulations that prohibited pharmacist dispensing of the medication. Reproductive health advocates in Canada recognized this regulation would limit access to medical abortion and successfully worked to have this regulation removed in 2017. The purpose of this study was to assess the leadership involved in changing these regulations so that the success may be replicated by other groups advocating for health policy change.\nMETHODS:\nThis study involved a mixed methods instrumental design in the context of British Columbia, Canada. Our data collection included: a) interviews with seven key individuals, representing the organizations that worked in concert for change to Canadian mifepristone regulations, and b) document analysis of press articles, correspondence, briefing notes, and meeting minutes. We conducted a thematic analysis of transcripts of audio-recorded interviews. We identified strengths and weaknesses of the team dynamic using the Develop Coalitions, Achieve Results and Systems Transformation domains of the LEADS Framework.\nRESULTS:\nOur analysis of participant interviews indicates that autonomy, shared values, and clarity in communication were integral to the success of the group's work. Analysis using the LEADS Framework showed that individuals possessed many of the capabilities identified as being necessary for successful health policy leadership. A lack of post-project assessment was identified as a possible limitation and could be incorporated in future work to strengthen dynamics especially when a desired outcome is not achieved. Document analysis provided a clear time-line of the work completed and suggested that strong communication between team members was another key to success.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThe results of our analysis of the interviews and documents provide valuable insight into the workings of a successful group committed to a common goal. The existing collegial and trusting relationships between key stakeholders allowed for interdisciplinary collaboration, rapid mobilization, and identification of issues that facilitated successful Canadian global-first deregulation of mifepristone dispensing."}, {"authors": ["Mizana BA", "Woyecha T", "Abdu S"], "topic": "Abortion", "title": "Delay in decision and determinants for safe abortion among women at health facilities in south West Ethiopia: facility based cross sectional study.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6947820/", "publication": "Int J Equity Health. 2020 Jan 7;19(1):7. doi: 10.1186/s12939-020-1122-z.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nDelayed safe abortion is the most common cause of gynecologic admission in developing countries. The study, therefore, assessed the delay decision for safe abortion and determinant factors among women at health facilities in South West Ethiopia.\nMETHODS:\nFacility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 384 women who were selected from health facilities by using simple random sampling. A pre-tested structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Data were entered into Epidata and exported to SPSS for analysis. Binary Logistic regression was used and Variables with P-value < 0.25 during bivariate analysis were included in the multivariable logistic regression model.

Arguments were furthered through appropriation by misrepresenting medical science and co-opting the legal successes of progressive movements. Our analysis provides an initial understanding of evolving early abortion ban strategy and its tactics for challenging established legal standards and precedent.

They may display a vast array of forms, according to the interaction of the virus with the host's immunity. Cellular immunity is the epithelium's main form of defense against the virus, involving an active participation of the Langerhans cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α.\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo assess the epithelial immune response of anogenital warts in males, according to the number of lesions presented.\nMETHODS:\nThis is a prospective, cross-sectional study carried out at the dermatology outpatient clinic in a tertiary hospital. We included male patients over 18 years of age without comorbidities who had anogenital condylomata and no previous treatments.In order to evaluate the local epithelial immunity, the lesions were quantified, then removed and employed in CD1a immunohistochemistry assays for assessing the morphometry and morphology of Langerhans cells; TNF-α; reaction was used for determining cytokine positivity in the epithelium.\nRESULTS:\n48 patients were included in the study. There was no statistically significant difference as to the number of Langerhans cells, in their morphology, or the presence of TNF-α. However, patients presenting with more Langerhans cells in the lesions had cells with a star-like and dendritic morphology, whereas in those with a lower cell count had cells with a rounded morphology and no dendrites (p<0.001).\nSTUDY LIMITATIONS:\nSmall number of patients analyzed.\nCONCLUSION:\nThere was no difference in epithelial immunity between patients having few or many anogenital condyloma lesions as measured by the morphology and morphometry of Langerhans cells and TNF-α; positivity. Such an assessment employing immunity markers differing from the usual ones is expected to yield useful results.\nCopyright © 2020 Sociedade Brasileira de Dermatologia.

Here, we evaluated the efficacy of ALA-PDT in the context of different HPV infection states.\nMETHODS:\nOne hundred thirty-eight patients with HPV infection and visible anogenital warts were enrolled.

Treatment was halted after the patient showed two negative results for HPV DNA detection in a row.\nRESULTS:\nOf the 138 patients enrolled in the study, 72 completed treatment. Multisite HPV-infected patients required more sessions of PDT than did single-site infected patients to reach the endpoint of treatment. Compared with patients with only external CA, individuals with internal CA required more sessions to eliminate HPV infection. The total number of PDT sessions performed in the multitype HPV-infected group was significantly higher than that in the single-type infected group.

Transurethral resections of the urinary bladder were obtained from 25 males with a median age of 73 years (range: 41 to 87 y) and 13 females with a median age of 68 years (range: 30 to 86 y). The follow-up period ranged from 15 months to 20 years (median: 6 y). Bladder lesions were accompanied by urethral lesions in 4 men. Eight patients (8/38; 21.0%) had a history of immunosuppression. Seven patients (7/8; 87.5%) from this group had multiple and/or recurrent condylomas. One patient (1/38; 2.6%) with renal transplantation had 10 separate bladder condylomas over time. One patient (1/38; 2.6%) had extensive anogenital condylomas and anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3. One patient (1/8; 12.5%) with renal transplantation presented with a solitary condyloma with synchronous squamous cell carcinoma in situ. Three female patients (3/38; 7.9%) had a history of premalignant vagina/cervix lesions. In total, 17 patients (17/38; 44.7%) had squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder, either invasive or in situ. In all cases, the squamous cell carcinoma (either in situ or invasive) was diagnosed either concurrent with the diagnosis of bladder condyloma or within 1 year of the condyloma diagnosis). In total, 9 of 38 (23.7%) patients had invasive squamous cell carcinoma with or without in situ squamous cell carcinoma. Eight of 38 (21.0%) patients had squamous cell carcinoma in situ only (without a definitive invasive component-in 3 cases invasive squamous cell carcinoma could not be excluded with certainty). In total, 19 patients (19/38; 50%) were positive for either low-risk human papillomavirus (LR-HPV) or high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) or both (3 were positive for both LR-HPV and HR-HPV, 12 patients for only LR-HPV, and 4 for only HR-HPV). Of the 19 patients that were negative for both LR-HPV and HR-HPV, 9 of 19 (47.4%) patients had associated squamous cell carcinoma. Of the 12 patients with only LR-HPV, 4 (33.3%) had associated squamous cell carcinoma (either invasive or in situ). Of the 7 patients with HR-HPV (with or without LR-HPV), 4 (57.1%) has associated squamous cell carcinoma. In summary, condyloma acuminatum of the urinary bladder shows a strong association with squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder, regardless of the condyloma's HPV in situ hybridization results. Immunosuppression is associated with condylomas of the bladder. It is important to distinguish bladder condylomas from papillary urothelial carcinoma, given their different risks for panurothelial disease and risk of squamous cell carcinoma. Recognition of bladder condylomas histologically is often challenging given their rarity, and that they can be negative for both LR-HPV and HR-HPV.

Previous studies have shown that 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy can inhibit proliferation of condyloma acuminatum keratinocytes. However, the effect of 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy on condyloma acuminatum tissues has not been systematically studied. Here, we investigated possible molecular mechanisms of 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy in the treatment of condyloma acuminatum and its effect on the expression of apoptosis inhibitors Bcl-2 and Survivin.\nMETHODS:\nImmunohistochemistry streptavidin-peroxidase was used to detect the expression of apoptosis inhibitors Bcl-2 and Survivin in condyloma acuminatum keratinocytes before and after the therapy.\nRESULTS:\nThe positive expression rates of Bcl-2 and Survivin in condyloma acuminatum keratinocytes before treatment were 87.50% (42/48) and 79.16% (38/48), respectively. The positive expression rates of Bcl-2 and Survivin in condyloma acuminatum keratinocytes after treatment were 37.50% (18/48) and 41.67% (20/48), respectively. The positive expression intensity of Bcl-2 and Survivin in condyloma acuminatum keratinocytes before 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy was mostly ++ to +++, and that after treatment was mostly - to +. There were statistically significant differences in the positive expression rate and the expression intensity of Bcl-2 and Survivin in the two groups before and after 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (P <  0.001). There was a positive correlation between the expression of Bcl-2 and Survivin in condyloma acuminatum tissues after 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (r = 0.480, P <  0.05).\nCONCLUSION:\n5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy may promote apoptosis of condyloma acuminatum cells by reducing the expression of Bcl-2 and Survivin, suggesting that this is potentially one of the molecular mechanisms of 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy in the treatment of condyloma acuminatum.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore it is crucial to evaluate PDT for safety and its impact on fertility and delivery of healthy newborns.\nOBJECTIVE:\nThe study analyzed the PDT treatment of 10 young women, who suffered from diseases of the vulva and cervix. The aim of the analysis was evaluating what impact PDT treatment had on their pregnancies and delivery.\nMETHODS:\n10 patients (22-32 years of age, 25.5 years of age on average) were treated with PDT in 2007-2014. 2 patients suffered from squamous cell hyperplasia, 2 patients from vulvar lichen sclerosus, 1 - genital warts, 1 - VIN I (current terminology: LSIL/Flat condyloma), 2 - CIN III (HSIL), 2 - CIN I (LSIL). The patients underwent photodynamic therapy (PDT). In the course of PDT the 5% 5- aminolevulinic acid was used in gel form three hours before irradiation. The affected areas were irradiated with a halogen lamp PhotoDyn 501 (590-760 nm) during a 10-min radiation treatment. The treatment was repeated weekly for 10 weeks.\nRESULTS:\nThe median observation time period between the end of therapy and delivery was 3.92 years (2-7 years). None of the patients suffered from infertility. All patients gave birth to healthy, full-term infants. In case of one pregnancy cervical cerclage was needed. Two patients were treated for hypothyroidism caused by the Hashimoto disease. One patient had gestational diabetes. Two patients had already given birth to 2 children. Five patients gave birth by caesarean section.\nCONCLUSION:\nTopical PDT selectively used for treating the diseases of the female reproductive organs was applied in our group of patients and proved to be a safe method. It had no apparent negative impact on female fertility and allowed these women to give birth to healthy children.\nCopyright © 2019.

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of the population-level impact of vaccinating girls and women against human papillomavirus on HPV infections, anogenital wart diagnoses, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+ (CIN2+) to summarise the most recent evidence about the effectiveness of HPV vaccines in real-world settings and to quantify the impact of multiple age-cohort vaccination.\nMETHODS:\nIn this updated systematic review and meta-analysis, we used the same search strategy as in our previous paper. We searched MEDLINE and Embase for studies published between Feb 1, 2014, and Oct 11, 2018. Studies were eligible if they compared the frequency (prevalence or incidence) of at least one HPV-related endpoint (genital HPV infections, anogenital wart diagnoses, or histologically confirmed CIN2+) between pre-vaccination and post-vaccination periods among the general population and if they used the same population sources and recruitment methods before and after vaccination. Our primary assessment was the relative risk (RR) comparing the frequency (prevalence or incidence) of HPV-related endpoints between the pre-vaccination and post-vaccination periods. We stratified all analyses by sex, age, and years since introduction of HPV vaccination. We used random-effects models to estimate pooled relative risks.\nFINDINGS:\nWe identified 1702 potentially eligible articles for this systematic review and meta-analysis, and included 65 articles in 14 high-income countries: 23 for HPV infection, 29 for anogenital warts, and 13 for CIN2+. After 5-8 years of vaccination, the prevalence of HPV 16 and 18 decreased significantly by 83% (RR 0·17, 95% CI 0·11-0·25) among girls aged 13-19 years, and decreased significantly by 66% (RR 0·34, 95% CI 0·23-0·49) among women aged 20-24 years. The prevalence of HPV 31, 33, and 45 decreased significantly by 54% (RR 0·46, 95% CI 0·33-0·66) among girls aged 13-19 years. Anogenital wart diagnoses decreased significantly by 67% (RR 0·33, 95% CI 0·24-0·46) among girls aged 15-19 years, decreased significantly by 54% (RR 0·46, 95% CI 0.36-0.60) among women aged 20-24 years, and decreased significantly by 31% (RR 0·69, 95% CI 0·53-0·89) among women aged 25-29 years. Among boys aged 15-19 years anogenital wart diagnoses decreased significantly by 48% (RR 0·52, 95% CI 0·37-0·75) and among men aged 20-24 years they decreased significantly by 32% (RR 0·68, 95% CI 0·47-0·98). After 5-9 years of vaccination, CIN2+ decreased significantly by 51% (RR 0·49, 95% CI 0·42-0·58) among screened girls aged 15-19 years and decreased significantly by 31% (RR 0·69, 95% CI 0·57-0·84) among women aged 20-24 years.\nINTERPRETATION:\nThis updated systematic review and meta-analysis includes data from 60 million individuals and up to 8 years of post-vaccination follow-up. Our results show compelling evidence of the substantial impact of HPV vaccination programmes on HPV infections and CIN2+ among girls and women, and on anogenital warts diagnoses among girls, women, boys, and men.

Autophagy plays an important role in maintaining internal environmental stability. However, the role of autophagy regulation in the anogenital warts caused by HPV infection remains unknown.\nOBJECTIVE:\nA multigroup case-control study was designed to identify the autophagy gene fingerprint involved in anogenital warts arising from infections with different HPV genotypes.\nMETHODS:\nHuman autophagy PCR arrays were performed on the initial 18 participants grouped by their different HPV genotypes for gene expression-profiling analysis. The negative control was skin samples collected during plastic surgery on the chest from a group of individuals who showed none of the clinical symptoms or evidence of HPV infection. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to validate the microarray results in another 24 individuals.\nRESULTS:\nOut of 84 genes involved in autophagy, different autophagic responses were found among the 29 genes that encode autophagy machinery components, and expression levels of 13 of these genes were downregulated. Finally, we verified that the expression levels of 2 key genes that participate in the formation of autophagosomes, ATG3 and -BECLIN1, were downregulated in the HPV infection groups independently of genotype compared with the control group.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThese findings showed that HPV infection downregulated the expression of ATGs in CA. Additionally, there were no differences in the expression of ATGs between the different HPV genotype infection groups.

Demographic data, side effects, and outcomes of therapy were recorded for each patient, and overall efficacy was determined.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 37 patients met inclusion criteria. Responses were seen in 8 out of 9 patients treated with sinecatechins 15% ointment (5 full, 3 partial, and 1 no response) and 9 out of 17 patients treated with imiquimod 5% cream (4 full, 5 partial, and 8 no response). Combination therapy with one or more of the following treatments (podophyllin, cimetidine, candida antigen injection, and HPV vaccine) were evaluated, but no combination was objectively superior to the others. No significant difference was found in overall efficacy between sinecatechins and imiquimod. Side effects were mild and limited to irritation and erythema.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nBoth imiquimod 5% cream and sinecatechins 15% ointment are moderately effective in the treatment of AV in preadolescent children, with a trend toward greater effectiveness of sinecatechins. Combination therapy with other treatments did not significantly increase the effectiveness of topical therapies.

Regular follow-up over 16 months showed no evidence of the recurrence of vaginal adenosis or cancer.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nBased on the evolution of a series of pathological evidence, we report the fourth case in the world of vaginal clear cell carcinoma originating from vaginal adenosis without prenatal DES exposure.

Patient recurred two years after completion of her primary chemoradiation at the posterior upper vagina. Pelvic MRI showed an approximately 4 cm tumoral nodule, without invasion into rectum or to bilateral parametria. PET-CT ruled out any metastatic disease. She was explained of the palliative systemic treatment versus potentially curative pelvic exenteration, as her options. After extensive counseling, she opted for the surgical option. Given her extensive comorbidities, including poorly controlled diabetes, COPD, obesity and heavy smoking, decision was made to attempt the procedure with a robotic approach (Behbehani et al.; Kammar et al. [1,2]). The technical steps of posterior Type IIB exenteration have been detailed in the video with an emphasis on anatomic landmarks by utilizing visual illustrations (Cibula [3]). The surgical margins were deemed to be negative with frozen section evaluation. Intravenous indocyanine green injection confirmed adequate blood supply to the end colostomy site. Patency of bilateral ureters was confirmed at the end of the procedure.\nRESULTS:\nRobotic-assisted Type IIB posterior pelvic exenteration was successfully completed without any intra-operative complications. Patient was discharged home on post-operative day 8. She has been dispositioned to surveillance.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nRobotic approach to highly morbid pelvic exenteration procedures should be considered in selected patients with recurrent gynecologic malignancies, who present without evidence of distant metastatic disease.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

As there is no consensus for 3D vaginal brachytherapy (BT) contouring, the goals of this study are to evaluate the variability in practices and contouring, and to develop consensus concepts on target definitions.\nMETHODS:\nA survey/contouring study was conducted with 16 radiation oncologists from 10 Canadian academic centers. The study included three vaginal ISBT cases. Participants were provided staging, prebrachytherapy (pre-BT), and BT MRIs. Participants responded to a questionnaire and contoured on the provided images. Agreement between contours was analyzed. A meeting was held to develop consensus definitions of targets.\nRESULTS:\nMedian ISBT experience was 3.5 years. All 16 participants regularly contour with MRI, whereas three also plan on MRI. For the three cases, there was variation into how CTVHR and CTVIR was defined. Kappa statistics showed higher agreement with bulky tumors (mean 0.59) as compared with small residual tumors (mean 0.29). For all cases, kappa was highest in pre-BT GTVres as compared with BT GTVres (mean 0.58, 0.46). Consensus concepts to define targets were developed.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nVariations exist in how ISBT targets are defined for vaginal tumors. Highest contouring variability was seen with small residual at BT. Contouring is more consistent on pre-BT MRI as compared with BT MRI suggesting a needle distortion effect. Consensus CTVHR and CTVIR definitions have been developed and further work is warranted to establish international standards.\nCopyright © 2019 American Brachytherapy Society.

The aim of this study was to review all primary vaginal malignancies diagnosed in an oncologic referral centre over 11 years. A total of 35 cases were retrospectively analysed, including clinical and MRI features. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was the most frequent histologic subtype (77.1%), followed by adenocarcinoma (14.3%). There was no statistically significant difference for the mean age at diagnosis or for the mean largest diameter of the tumour. Most SCCs (95%) were homogeneous on T2-weighted imaging, while all adenocarcinomas were heterogeneous (p = .0001). Concerning location, both SCCs (59.3%) and adenocarcinomas (80%) occurred more often on the upper third. However, regarding the wall of origin, all adenocarcinomas originated on the anterior vaginal wall (p = .0002), while SCCs (62.5%) had a predisposition for the posterior wall (p = .017). Regarding the history of previous hysterectomy, in the SCC group, 73.3% of patients with previous hysterectomies had cervical dysplasia (p = .018). Impact statement What is already known on this subject? MRI plays an important role in the initial approach of primary vaginal malignancies. In previous studies, it is said that SCCs usually appear homogeneous on T2WI, with the intermediate-high signal, while adenocarcinomas are often homogeneously hyperintense. Regarding location, it is known that SCCs usually arise from the posterior wall of the upper third, while adenocarcinomas often originate on the anterior wall of the proximal third. What do the results of this study add? In this study, we found that all of our cases of adenocarcinomas were heterogeneous on T2WI, with high-signal intensity areas, while SCCs were predominantly homogeneous, and this association was statistically significant. We could also confirm the data in the literature regarding the most common location of these tumours. This study also showed an association between vaginal SCC and a previous hysterectomy with cervical dysplasia. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? The histologic type of vaginal malignancy has clinical and management impact. Although MRI is usually performed after histologic characterisation, this is not always the case. We think that this study can constitute a starting point to better understand the MRI features of these rare tumours. Although this technique will obviously never preclude histologic characterisation, it may provide some initial hint on the type of tumour and its aggressiveness."}, {"authors": ["Ager BJ", "Francis SR", "Do OA", "Huang YJ", "Soisson AP", "Dodson MK", "Werner TL", "Sause WT", "Grant JD", "Gaffney DK"], "topic": "Vaginal Cancer", "title": "Do vaginal recurrence rates differ among adjuvant vaginal brachytherapy regimens in early-stage endometrial cancer?", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brachy.2019.03.001", "publication": "Brachytherapy. 2019 Jul - Aug;18(4):453-461. doi: 10.1016/j.brachy.2019.03.001.

Cases underwent evaluation that included maternal interview, chart abstraction, biospecimen collection, fetal autopsy, and placental pathology. Recommended evaluations included syphilis and parvovirus serology. Each case was assigned probable and possible causes of death using the INCODE Stillbirth Classification System. Cases where infection was assigned as a probable or possible cause of death were reviewed. For these cases, clinical scenario, autopsy, maternal serology, culture results, and placental pathology were evaluated.\nRESULTS:\nFor 66 (12.9%) cases of stillbirth, infection was identified as a probable or possible cause of death. Of these, 36% (95% CI 35-38%) were categorized as a probable and 64% (95% CI 62-65%) as a possible cause of death. Infection-related stillbirth occurred earlier than non-infection-related stillbirth (median gestational age 22 vs 28 weeks, P=.001). Fetal bacterial culture results were available in 47 cases (71%), of which 35 (53%) grew identifiable organisms.

Globally, there are over 2.6 million stillbirths annually and progress in reducing these deaths has been slow. Maternal perception of decreased fetal movements (DFM) is strongly associated with stillbirth. However, maternal awareness of DFM and clinical management of women reporting DFM is often suboptimal. The My Baby's Movements trial aims to evaluate an intervention package for maternity services including a mobile phone application for women and clinician education (MBM intervention) in reducing late gestation stillbirth rates.\nMETHODS/DESIGN:\nThis is a stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled trial with sequential introduction of the MBM intervention to 8 groups of 3-5 hospitals at four-monthly intervals over 3 years. The target population is women with a singleton pregnancy, without lethal fetal abnormality, attending for antenatal care and clinicians providing maternity care at 26 maternity services in Australia and New Zealand. The primary outcome is stillbirth from 28 weeks' gestation. Secondary outcomes address: a) neonatal morbidity and mortality; b) maternal psychosocial outcomes and health-seeking behaviour; c) health services utilisation; d) women's and clinicians' knowledge of fetal movements; and e) cost. 256,700 births (average of 3170 per hospital) will detect a 30% reduction in stillbirth rates from 3/1000 births to 2/1000 births, assuming a significance level of 5%. Analysis will utilise generalised linear mixed models.\nDISCUSSION:\nMaternal perception of DFM is a marker of an at-risk pregnancy and commonly precedes a stillbirth. MBM offers a simple, inexpensive resource to reduce the number of stillborn babies, and families suffering the distressing consequences of such a loss. This large pragmatic trial will provide evidence on benefits and potential harms of raising awareness of DFM using a mobile phone app.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION:\nACTRN12614000291684.

Having a stillborn baby has a wide range of consequences that can affect parents, family and the healthcare professionals involved. Several risk factors have been associated with an increased risk of stillbirth: including maternal medical factors, maternal characteristics, fetal factors, sociodemographic factors and behavioral factors. The aim of this work is to review the literature on risk factors that have a behavioral component. The main behaviors modulating the risk of stillbirth that have been more widely studied in the literature include use of substances (smoking, alcohol, illicit drugs and medical drugs), weight management, attendance at antenatal care and sleeping position. There is evidence in the literature that supports that all those behaviors have an impact on the risk of stillbirth, especially in the cases of smoking and drugs consumption during the pregnancy. Hence, more research is needed to establish interventions targeting these behaviors as preventive measures to reduce the risk of adverse obstetric outcomes.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Main maternal outcomes were: gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, placenta previa, c-section and prolonged hospitalization (≥ 7 days). Main adverse perinatal outcomes were: stillbirth, prematurity, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, low birth weight, need of admission at a neonatal intensive care unit and perinatal mortality. Adjustment for confounding factors (smoking, previous comorbilities, parity, assisted reproductive techniques (ART) and obesity) was performed.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 25054 pregnancies were included.

After adjusting for confounding factors, maternal age was an independent and statistically significant risk factor for gestational diabetes (OR 1.66/2.80/3.14) for ages 30-39, 40-44 and ≥ 45 years respectively, c-section (OR 1.28/2.41/7.27) and placenta previa (OR 2.56/4.83) for ages 40-44 and ≥ 45 years respectively, but not for preeclampsia (neither early-onset nor late-onset). Risk of emergency c-section was only increased in women ≥45 years (OR, 2.03 (95% CI, 1.50-2.74). In the other groups of age, the increase in c-section rate was because of elective indications.

In many countries where FGM/C is traditionally practiced, the prevalence rates of medicalization are increasing, and in countries of migration, such as the United Kingdom, the United States of America or Sweden, court cases or the repeated issuing of statements in favor of presumed minimal forms of FGM/C to replace more invasive forms, has raised the debate between the medical harm reduction arguments and the human rights approach.\nMAIN BODY:\nThe purpose of this paper is to discuss the arguments associated with the medicalization of FGM/C, a trend that could undermine the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 5.3. The paper uses four country case studies, Egypt, Indonesia, Kenya and UK, to discuss the reasons for engaging in medicalized forms of FGM/C, or not, and explores the ongoing public discourse in those countries concerning harm reduction versus human rights, and the contradiction between medical ethics, national criminal justice systems and international conventions. The discussion is structured around four key hotly contested ethical dilemmas. Firstly, that the WHO definition of medicalized FGM/C is too narrow allowing medicalized FGM to be justified by many healthcare professionals as a form of harm reduction which contradicts the medical oath of do no harm. Secondly, that medicalized FGM/C is a human rights abuse with lifelong consequences, no matter who performs it. Thirdly, that health care professionals who perform medicalized FGM/C are sustaining cultural norms that they themselves support and are also gaining financially. Fourthly, the contradiction between protecting traditional cultural rights in legal constitutions versus human rights legislation, which criminalizes FGM/C.\nCONCLUSION:\nMore research needs to be done in order to understand the complexities that are facilitating the medicalization of FGM/C as well as how policy strategies can be strengthened to have a greater de-medicalization impact. Tackling medicalization of FGM/C will accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal of ending FGM by 2030."}, {"authors": ["Charlier P", "Deo S"], "topic": "Sexual Problems in Women", "title": "Paul Broca's clitoridectomy as a cure for \"nymphomania\": A pseudo-medical mutilation.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.7146/torture.v29i2.114013", "publication": "Torture. 2019;29(2):110-112. doi: 10.7146/torture.v29i2.114013.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nPaul Broca (1824-1880) is considered one of the founding fathers of modern neurology, mainly because of his major contribution to the anatomo-clinical method (Figure 1) (Sagan, 1979).

Results showed that daughters of cut women were highly likely to be cut. Also, the likelihood of a girl being cut increased with the proportion of women in the community (1) who were cut (2) who supported FGM/C continuation, and (3) who believed FGM/C was a religious obligation.

Many studies show growing opposition to these practices among people who have migrated to Europe, and there is little evidence to support the assertion that large-scale illegal activities are prevalent. Yet there is a dominant discourse stating that FGM is secretively practised on a large scale among some immigrant groups in Europe, and policies encourage the detection of cases to charge in criminal court. I describe the current situation in Sweden and highlight some of the drawbacks of a very harsh, although well-intended, policy to check for FGM in Europe.

Some experts propose that FGM/C increases risk of genital trauma and bleeding. Given the known protective effect for men of male circumcision against HIV and that, in some communities, male circumcision and FGM/C are thought of as \"equivalent\" or parallel procedures, there is an obvious need to more accurately determine the effects of FGM/C on HIV infection risk in women. This article reviewed current evidence of associations between FGM/C and HIV, drawing on evidence from peer-reviewed as well as grey literature. All studies evaluated were observational. This review investigated associations between FGM/C and HIV, not a causal relationship, and observational studies therefore sufficed. The final review included 14 studies from several African countries. The strength of the evidence overall was determined to be of low to moderate quality by Department for International Development criteria: conceptual framing, openness and transparency, cogency, appropriateness and rigour, validity, reliability, and cultural sensitivity. Findings were inconsistent: four studies found no association between FGM/C and HIV, six found a negative association, two found a positive association, and two found an indirect association. Many of the studies had significant deficiencies including insufficient statistical power, inadequate adjustment for potential confounders, and measurement of FGM/C status by self-reporting alone. The available evidence did not conclusively demonstrate the anticipated association between FGM/C and HIV.

Over the years, the government, civil society and the international community implemented multiple interventions to address the issue. However, due to a number of cultural and educational factors, this harmful practice continues.\nAIMS:\nThis study aimed to assess the effects of a secondary school-based health education intervention on the knowledge and attitude of female students towards FGM in Sudan.\nMETHODS:\nWe conducted a quasi-experimental study in Karary Locality, Khartoum State, Sudan. A multistage sampling technique was used to determine targeted schools. Within the schools, students of two randomly selected classes received the intervention. The study included three phases; in the pre-intervention phase, data were collected from the totality of students (154 students) using a pre-tested questionnaire, after which students received health education sessions. The same questionnaire was used to re-collect the data in a post-intervention phase 6 weeks later.\nRESULTS:\nThe participants were between 14 to 17 years old, 30.3% of which were subjected to FGM. The main source of information about FGM was family and friends (41.1%). The majority of participants had a negative attitude towards FGM.

The medicalization of FGM/C has been increasing significantly in Egypt making it the country with the highest rate of medicalization. In this qualitative study, we explored the drivers and motives behind why healthcare professionals perform FGM/C and why mothers rely on them to perform the practice on their daughters.\nMETHODS:\nThe study drew on a \"mystery client\" approach, coupled with in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) with health care providers (i.e. physicians and nurses) and mothers. It was conducted in three geographic areas in Egypt: Cairo, Assiut and Al Gharbeya.\nRESULTS:\nStudy findings suggest that parents who seek medicalized cutting often do so to minimize health risks while conforming to social expectations. Thus, the factors that support FGM/C overlap with the factors that support medicalization. For many mothers and healthcare providers, adherence to community customs and traditions was the most important motive to practice FGM/C. Also, the social construction of girls' well-being and bodily beauty makes FGM/C a perceived necessity which lays the ground for stigmatization against uncut girls. Finally, the language around FGM/C is being reframed by many healthcare providers as a cosmetic surgery. Such reframing may be one way for providers to overcome the law against FGM/C and market the operation to the clients.\nCONCLUSION:\nThese contradictions and contestations highlighted in this study among mothers and healthcare providers suggest that legal, moral and social norms that underpin FGM/C practice are not harmonized and would thus lead to a further rise in the medicalization of FGM/C.

The aim of the study was to gather knowledge that could improve interventions among migrant populations. The study findings indicate that the experience of FGC as a practice in transition implies that people have to maneuver between different and partly contradictory social norms. The paper first discusses the contradiction between a strong negative attitude toward FGC and very low engagement. The lack of engagement is explained by the increased privatization of FGC and insecurities due to the transition and disempowerment with regard to challenging the FGC practices of relatives based in countries of origin. Second, the paper explores the contradiction between perceptions of FGC as a disappearing practice and the recognition of trends of continuation. Trends of continuation include those related to perceptions of risk during travel to countries of origin, resistance to defibulation, support for sunna circumcision and insecurities regarding the significance of FGC for marriageability. Thus, despite an almost universally negative attitude toward FGC in the form of infibulation, ongoing changes can, to some extent, hamper further change. This suggests that to ensure further progress in the abandonment of the practice, these complex and interconnected expectations must be addressed."}, {"authors": ["Zhai SJ", "Ruan Y", "Liu Y", "Lin Z", "Xia C", "Fang FF", "Zhou QH"], "topic": "Menstruation", "title": "Time-effective analgesic effect of acupressure ankle strip pressing wrist and ankle acupuncture point on primary dysmenorrhea: Study protocol clinical trial (SPIRIT compliant).", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000019496", "publication": "Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Mar;99(12):e19496. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000019496.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nDysmenorrhea seriously affects the ability of women to perform normal social activities and decreases their quality of life.

Elagolix, an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist resulting in rapid, reversible suppression of ovarian sex hormones, may reduce fibroid-associated bleeding.\nMETHODS:\nWe conducted two identical, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 6-month phase 3 trials (Elaris Uterine Fibroids 1 and 2 [UF-1 and UF-2]) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of elagolix at a dose of 300 mg twice daily with hormonal \"add-back\" therapy (to replace reduced levels of endogenous hormones; in this case, estradiol, 1 mg, and norethindrone acetate, 0.5 mg, once daily) in women with fibroid-associated bleeding. An elagolix-alone group was included to assess the impact of add-back therapy on the hypoestrogenic effects of elagolix. The primary end point was menstrual blood loss of less than 80 ml during the final month of treatment and at least a 50% reduction in menstrual blood loss from baseline to the final month; missing data were imputed with the use of multiple imputation.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 412 women in UF-1 and 378 women in UF-2 underwent randomization, received elagolix or placebo, and were included in the analyses. Criteria for the primary end point were met in 68.5% of 206 women in UF-1 and in 76.5% of 189 women in UF-2 who received elagolix plus add-back therapy, as compared with 8.7% of 102 women and 10% of 94 women, respectively, who received placebo (P<0.001 for both trials). Among the women who received elagolix alone, the primary end point was met in 84.1% of 104 women in UF-1 and in 77% of 95 women in UF-2. Hot flushes (in both trials) and metrorrhagia (in UF-1) occurred significantly more commonly with elagolix plus add-back therapy than with placebo. Hypoestrogenic effects of elagolix, especially decreases in bone mineral density, were attenuated with add-back therapy.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nElagolix with add-back therapy was effective in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding in women with uterine fibroids.

This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this technique for pain relief in patients with primary dysmenorrhea as compared with a conventional pain medication.\nMETHODS:\nThe present study is a perspective, randomized, ibuprofen-controlled trial. Sixty-two eligible participants were randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive either acupuncture treatment or ibuprofen administration. The treatment lasted for three menstrual cycles for both groups. The primary outcome was the intensity of menstrual pain measured by using the visual analogue scale at the completion of treatment. Secondary outcomes included the severity of symptoms associated with menstrual pain, responder rate, and safety of acupuncture treatment. The clinical outcomes were measured on each menstrual cycle at baseline, treatment course (3 cycles), and follow-up period.\nRESULTS:\nSixty-four patients of primary dysmenorrhea were recruited, and 62 subjects were included in the final analysis. At trial completion, acupuncture was shown to be associated with a significantly lower pain intensity and decreased symptom severity of primary dysmenorrhea as compared with ibuprofen (p < 0.05). A significantly higher responder rate was found in the acupuncture group as compared with the control group (p < 0.05).

Regarding the duration of pain and quality of life, there was low evidence and very low evidence, respectively. In the 3 meta-analyses, the results were significantly positive in favor of exercise for decreases in both the intensity and the duration of pain.\nLIMITATIONS:\nLimitations of this study include the great heterogeneity of the interventions applied in the studies in terms of type of exercise, in combination or alone, and dosage. This review includes a small number of studies with risk of bias, so the present findings must be interpreted with caution.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nTherapeutic exercise reduces pain intensity in patients with primary dysmenorrhea.\n© 2019 American Physical Therapy Association."}, {"authors": ["Xu L", "Xie T", "Shen T", "Zhang T"], "topic": "Menstruation", "title": "Effect of Chinese herbal medicine on primary dysmenorrhea: A protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6756727/", "publication": "Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Sep;98(38):e17191. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000017191.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nPrimary dysmenorrhea (PD), the most common gynecological diseases, seriously affects women's life and work; however, without more effective treatment.

We evaluated the effect of automated interactive voice messages promoting contraceptive use with a focus on long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) among women in Bangladesh who had undergone menstrual regulation (MR), a procedure to \"regulate the menstrual cycle when menstruation is absent for a short duration.\"\nMETHODS:\nWe recruited MR clients from 41 public- and private-sector clinics immediately after MR. Eligibility criteria included having a personal mobile phone and consenting to receive messages about family planning by phone. We randomized participants remotely to an intervention group that received at least 11 voice messages about contraception over 4 months or to a control group (no messages). The primary outcome was LARC use at 4 months. Adverse events measured included experience of intimate partner violence (IPV). Researchers recruiting participants and 1 analyst were blinded to allocation groups. All analyses were intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02579785).\nRESULTS:\nBetween December 2015 and March 2016, 485 women were allocated to the intervention group and 484 to the control group. We completed follow-up on 389 intervention and 383 control participants. Forty-eight (12%) participants in the intervention group and 59 (15%) in the control group reported using a LARC method at 4 months (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] using multiple imputation=0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.49 to 1.83; P=.22). Reported physical IPV was higher in the intervention group: 42 (11%) intervention versus 25 (7%) control (aOR=1.97; 95% CI=1.12 to 3.46; P=.03) when measured using a closed question naming acts of violence. No violence was reported in response to an open question about effects of being in the study.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThe intervention did not increase LARC use but had an unintended consequence of increasing self-reported IPV. Researchers and health program designers should consider possible negative impacts when designing and evaluating mHealth and other reproductive health interventions. IPV must be measured using closed questions naming acts of violence.\n© Reiss et al."}, {"authors": ["Cooper K", "Breeman S", "Scott NW", "Scotland G", "Clark J", "Hawe J", "Hawthorn R", "Phillips K", "MacLennan G", "Wileman S", "McCormack K", "Hernández R", "Norrie J", "Bhattacharya S", "HEALTH Study Group"], "topic": "Menstruation", "title": "Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy versus endometrial ablation for women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HEALTH): a parallel-group, open-label, randomised controlled trial.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6891255/", "publication": "Lancet. 2019 Oct 19;394(10207):1425-1436. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(19)31790-8.

Hysterectomy is effective but has more complications than endometrial ablation, which is less invasive but ultimately leads to hysterectomy in 20% of women. We compared laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy with endometrial ablation in women seeking surgical treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding.\nMETHODS:\nIn this parallel-group, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial in 31 hospitals in the UK, women younger than 50 years who were referred to a gynaecologist for surgical treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding and who were eligible for endometrial ablation were randomly allocated (1:1) to either laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy or second generation endometrial ablation. Women were randomly assigned by either an interactive voice response telephone system or an internet-based application with a minimisation algorithm based on centre and age group (<40 years vs ≥40 years). Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy involves laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery to remove the upper part of the uterus (the body) containing the endometrium. Endometrial ablation aims to treat heavy menstrual bleeding by destroying the endometrium, which is responsible for heavy periods. The co-primary clinical outcomes were patient satisfaction and condition-specific quality of life, measured with the menorrhagia multi-attribute quality of life scale (MMAS), assessed at 15 months after randomisation. Our analysis was based on the intention-to-treat principle. The trial was registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN49013893.\nFINDINGS:\nBetween May 21, 2014, and March 28, 2017, we enrolled and randomly assigned 660 women (330 in each group). 616 (93%) of 660 women were operated on within the study period, 588 (95%) of whom received the allocated procedure and 28 (5%) of whom had an alternative surgery. At 15 months after randomisation, more women allocated to laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy were satisfied with their operation compared with those in the endometrial ablation group (270 [97%] of 278 women vs 244 [87%] of 280 women; adjusted percentage difference 9·8, 95% CI 5·1-14·5; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2·53, 95% CI 1·83-3·48; p<0·0001). Women randomly assigned to laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy were also more likely to have the best possible MMAS score of 100 than women assigned to endometrial ablation (180 [69%] of 262 women vs 146 [54%] of 268 women; adjusted percentage difference 13·3, 95% CI 3·8-22·8; adjusted OR 1·87, 95% CI 1·31-2·67; p=0·00058). 14 (5%) of 309 women in the laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy group and 11 (4%) of 307 women in the endometrial ablation group had at least one serious adverse event (adjusted OR 1·30, 95% CI 0·56-3·02; p=0·54).\nINTERPRETATION:\nLaparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy is superior to endometrial ablation in terms of clinical effectiveness and has a similar proportion of complications, but takes longer to perform and is associated with a longer recovery.\nFUNDING:\nUK National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme.\nCopyright © 2019 The Author(s).

PTT rates varied by study, ranging from 10-40%. PTT was less severe (based on number of trichiatic eyelashes) than initial trichiasis for 72% of those developing PTT, and only 2% of eyelids were worse at follow up than pre-operatively. Eyelids with central only-trichiasis pre-operatively had lower rates of PTT than eyelids with peripheral only trichiasis in each of the three trials that included severe TT cases. 10% of eyelids with peripheral trichiasis pre-operatively that develop PTT have central TT post-operatively.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:\nPre-operative central trichiasis is less likely than peripheral trichiasis to be associated with subsequent PTT. Regardless of type of surgery, surgeon skill levels, or pre-operative trichiasis severity, the presence of peripheral trichiasis pre-operatively is associated with higher rates of PTT.

Even for the latter, it is only necessary to have an organ capable of gestation. Ways to favor mammogenesis and lactogenesis in trans* women have been established. There are protocols to promote lactation in trans* women, usually used for adoptive mothers or those whose children have been born through gestational surrogacy. Chestfeeding a baby could be the cause of feelings as diverse as gender dysphoria in the case of trans* men, and euphoria and affirmation of femininity in trans* women. This study involves a review of the available scientific literature addressing medical aspects related to pregnancy and lactation in trans* individuals, giving special attention to nursing care during perinatal care. There are scarce studies addressing care and specifically nursing care in trans* pregnancy and lactation.

Evidence suggests that one of the most effective strategies to increase breastfeeding is through peer counsellors. However, the experiences of peer counsellors has not been studied in depth. This study aimed to collect and report the experiences of peer counsellors participating in an intervention study to improve breastfeeding in urban Dhaka, Bangladesh.\nMETHODS:\nPeer counsellors underwent a 10 day training course in May 2013 which included practical sessions on position and attachment and common difficulties with breastfeeding. Home visits were conducted with new mothers and performance of peer counsellors was monitored by senior breastfeeding counsellors. The number of supervised home visits needed to achieve a satisfactory level of competency was recorded. Demographic data were collected and a structured interview was performed in the first six months of the project (May-September 2013). One structured interview per peer counsellor was conducted by the project manager at the project site office to gain understanding of their experiences in counselling mothers. The interview included some open-ended questions on specific aspects of the training that they found useful, challenges faced, and whether they developed close friendships with the mothers that they were counselling.\nRESULTS:\nSeventeen peer counsellors with an average age of 31 years (SD 6.8) and at least six years of schooling participated in the study. All peer counsellors were satisfied with their role and with the training that they received, and most felt that they were able to deal with common breastfeeding problems. The peer counsellors reported that building a personal rapport and establishing a peer-to-peer relationship was most important in supporting mothers to breastfeed. Common challenges included interruption of sessions by relatives/children, as well as mothers being too busy for the visits.\nCONCLUSION:\nIn future peer counselling for breastfeeding projects, more focus could be placed on the communications aspects of the training, especially in how to deal with non-supportive family members and managing interruptions effectively, as well as how to motivate and engage busy new mothers.\n© The Author(s). 2019."}, {"authors": ["Gardner H", "Kent JC", "Lai CT", "Geddes DT"], "topic": "Breastfeeding", "title": "Comparison of maternal milk ejection characteristics during pumping using infant-derived and 2-phase vacuum patterns.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6833300/", "publication": "Int Breastfeed J. 2019 Nov 6;14:47. doi: 10.1186/s13006-019-0237-6. eCollection 2019.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nMilk ejection characteristics remain consistent throughout 12 months of lactation in women who expressed breastmilk with an electric breast pump. In addition these characteristics appear to remain constant when women are breastfeeding or pumping suggesting that milk ejection is a robust physiological response. It is not known whether the stimulation of an infant at the breast in the early post partum period influences milk ejection patterns or whether this is a programmed event. However, as more data become available on the mechanisms involved in infant feeding, pumping patterns mimicking the infant more closely may provide enhanced results. The objective of this study was to compare milk ejection characteristics obtained when using a novel infant-derived pumping pattern with an established 2-phase pattern.\nMETHODS:\nA convenience sample of ten lactating mothers, 1 to 40 weeks of lactation with normal milk production were recruited in 2015. Each participated in two pumping sessions in which either a 2-phase pattern or infant-derived pattern were randomly assigned. Milk volume and milk ejection characteristics were recorded and the percentage of available milk removed (PAMR) was calculated. Statistical analysis used linear mixed effects modeling to determine any differences between breasts and pump patterns with the consideration of individual variability as a random effect.\nRESULTS:\nThe number of milk ejections and milk ejection characteristics did not differ between patterns. Milk volumes removed were 53.6 ± 28.5 ml (PAMR 58.2 ± 28.4) for the 2-phase pattern and and 54.2 ± 26.3 ml (PAMR 52.2 ± 22.3) for the infant derived pattern.

The question of a link between primary tooth caries and breastfeeding has been addressed for many years, with contradictory results. The concomitant decay of primary teeth, effective establishment, or not, of oral hygiene, and alimentary diversification away from breastfeeding are all confounding factors in this topic. The aim of our study was to analyze the links between breastfeeding and the appearance of caries, as described in the scientific literature and in the recommendations of specialist societies.\nMETHODS:\nA review of publications written in English and French was carried out, searching for the terms early childhood caries, decay and breastfeeding, focusing on literature reviews and meta-analyses dating from the past 10 years. The PubMed database of the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health (NBCI) was used. Furthermore, a review of specialist dental and pediatric societies was conducted.\nRESULTS:\nBreastfeeding until the age of 1 year is not associated with an increased risk of dental caries, and may even provide protection compared with feeding with formula milk. By contrast, infants who are breastfed beyond the age of 12 months demonstrate an increased risk of caries. However, the results derive from heterogeneous studies that do not always take into account contradictory factors such as eating habits of the mother or infant (feeding during the night, number of meals per day, eating sweet foods etc.), dental hygiene, or the sociocultural context. Moreover, the most recent recommendations of pediatric and dental societies advise breastfeeding until the age of 2 years, suggesting that this be accompanied by toothbrushing and better nutrition by reducing the frequency and consumption of sugary foods, aimed at helping parents choose prolonged breastfeeding.\nCONCLUSION:\nExtended breastfeeding is a protective factor for childhood caries under 1 year of age. Beyond 1 year, it is difficult to conclude between protection and aggravation of caries because of the multiplicity of confounding factors such as dietary patterns, which vary depending on countries and families, and problems of oral hygiene. In practical terms, when breastfeeding continues beyond 1 year, consultation with a dentist is necessary for examination and preventive advice regarding dietary practices (especially sugar intake), oral hygiene, or supplementary fluoride.\nCopyright © 2019 French Society of Pediatrics.

Children are particularly susceptible to the negative effects of air pollution due to their immaturity and excessive growth and development. The aims of this narrative review were to: (1) summarize evidence about the protective effects of breastfeeding on the adverse health effects of air pollution exposure, (2) define and describe the potential mechanisms underlying the protective effects of breastfeeding, and (3) examine the potential effects of air pollution on breastmilk composition and lactation. A literature search was conducted using electronic databases. Existing evidence suggests that breastfeeding has a protective effect on adverse outcomes of indoor and outdoor air pollution exposure in respiratory (infections, lung function, asthma symptoms) and immune (allergic, nervous and cardiovascular) systems, as well as under-five mortality in both developing and developed countries. However, some studies reported no protective effect of breastfeeding or even negative effects of breastfeeding for under-five mortality. Several possible mechanisms of the breastfeeding protective effect were proposed, including the beneficial influence of breastfeeding on immune, respiratory, and nervous systems, which are related to the immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and neuroprotective properties of breastmilk. Breastmilk components responsible for its protective effect against air pollutants exposure may be long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC PUFA), antioxidant vitamins, carotenoids, flavonoids, immunoglobins, and cytokines, some of which have concentrations that are diet-dependent. However, maternal exposure to air pollution is related to increased breastmilk concentrations of pollutants (e.g., Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) or heavy metals in particulate matter (PM)). Nonetheless, environmental studies have confirmed that breastmilk's protective effects outweigh its potential health risk to the infant. Mothers should be encouraged and supported to breastfeed their infants due to its unique health benefits, as well as its limited ecological footprint, which is associated with decreased waste production and the emission of pollutants."}, {"authors": ["Robinson DT", "Josefson J", "Van Horn L"], "topic": "Breastfeeding", "title": "Considerations for Preterm Human Milk Feedings When Caring for Mothers Who Are Overweight or Obese.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1097/ANC.0000000000000650", "publication": "Adv Neonatal Care. 2019 Oct;19(5):361-370. doi: 10.1097/ANC.0000000000000650.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nMother's milk is the recommended source of nutrition for all newborns.

Some drugs have been shown to be effective at treating dysmenorrhea. Therapeutic exercise is another option for reducing the symptomatology of this health problem, with a low cost and the absence of side effects.\nPURPOSE:\nThe purposes of this review were to study the efficacy of physical exercise for pain intensity in primary dysmenorrhea and to assess its effectiveness in decreasing the duration of pain and improving quality of life.\nDATA SOURCES:\nSearches were conducted between February 2017 and May 2017 in the databases Web of Science, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and Dialnet, using the terms dysmenorrhea, exercise therapy, exercise movement technique, exercise, physical therapy, physical therapy speciality, treatment, primary dysmenorrhea, prevention, etiology, epidemiology, and pain.\nSTUDY SELECTION:\nWe included randomized controlled trial studies conducted on women who were 16 to 25 years old and had primary dysmenorrhea, studies that included exercise as a type of therapy, studies that assessed the intensity and duration of pain and quality of life, and studies published in English or Spanish. Studies that included women with irregular cycles, women diagnosed with a gynecological disease, women who had had surgery, women with serious diseases, or women who used intracavitary or oral contraceptives were excluded. We started with 455 studies; 16 were included in the systematic review, and 11 were included in the 3 meta-analyses that were carried out.\nDATA EXTRACTION:\nTwo authors selected the studies and extracted their characteristics (participants, intervention, comparators, and outcomes) and results. The evaluation of the methodological quality of the studies was carried out by PEDro scale.\nDATA SYNTHESIS:\nThere was moderate evidence that therapeutic exercise can be considered a useful tool in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea in terms of a reduction in pain intensity. Regarding the duration of pain and quality of life, there was low evidence and very low evidence, respectively. In the 3 meta-analyses, the results were significantly positive in favor of exercise for decreases in both the intensity and the duration of pain.\nLIMITATIONS:\nLimitations of this study include the great heterogeneity of the interventions applied in the studies in terms of type of exercise, in combination or alone, and dosage. This review includes a small number of studies with risk of bias, so the present findings must be interpreted with caution.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nTherapeutic exercise reduces pain intensity in patients with primary dysmenorrhea.\n© 2019 American Physical Therapy Association."}, {"authors": ["Xu M", "Liu Y", "Guo Y", "Liu C", "Liu Y", "Yan Z", "Hou Y", "Li X", "Ma Q", "Zhou X", "Liu L", "Huang S", "Chen J"], "topic": "Premenstrual Syndrome", "title": "Study on urinary metabolomics of premenstrual dysphoric disorder patients with liver-qi depression syndrome treated with Xiaoyaosan: Study Protocol Clinical Trial (SPIRIT Compliant).", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000019425", "publication": "Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Apr;99(16):e19425. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000019425.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nINTRODUCTION:\nPremenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a serious form of premenstrual syndrome with mental symptoms as its main manifestation, which seriously affects women's health and daily life. Some basic research and clinical studies have shown that the Chinese herbal medicine of Xiaoyaosan can relieve the symptoms of mental disorders with few side effects. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of Xiaoyaosan for treating PMDD with liver-qi depression syndrome. In addition, metabonomics and small molecular marker compounds closely related to the pathogenesis of PMDD are expected to be found, and mechanism of Xiaoyaosan is further explored from the metabolic level.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS:\nThis study is a clinical pilot trial. Thirty PMDD patients with liver-qi depression syndrome and thirty healthy participants will be recruited. Study participants will be assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 2 groups: a normal control group and Xiaoyaosan treatment group. The treatment group will receive the Chinese patent medicine of Xiaoyaosan for 3 menstrual cycles. The primary outcome is the syndrome change in the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP). The secondary outcome is improvement in TCM syndrome, which will be measured with TCM symptom score scale. Urine metabolism profiles of participants by liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer (LC-MS) method will be measured to explore the mechanism of PMDD pathogenesis and action of Xiaoyaosan on PMDD.\nDISCUSSION:\nThis trial will evaluate the effectiveness and the therapeutic mechanism from the metabolomics level of Xiaoyaosan in individuals with PMDD.

The objective of this study was to compare efficacy of a broad-spectrum micronutrient formula (consisting mainly of minerals and vitamins) to a single vitamin (B6) for treatment of PMS, for which B6 has already been shown to be efficacious. Methods: This double-blind, randomized, treatment-controlled trial allocated 78 (72 completed) regularly menstruating women with PMS to consume micronutrients or vitamin B6 (80 mg/day) daily following a two-cycle baseline period, for three menstrual cycles. The primary outcome measure, Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP), established PMS as well as tracked change in five PMS symptoms: psychological, somatic, total symptoms, impact ratings, and worst day ratings. Results: Linear-mixed model analyses indicated both treatments produced comparable reduction in PMS symptoms with medium effect sizes (ES) across all PMS variables as measured by the DRSP (micronutrient ES = 0.50-0.56; B6 ES = 0.43-0.56), with 72% of the micronutrient and 60% of the vitamin B6 group identified as in full remission in PMS symptoms after three cycles. The micronutrient-treated participants showed greater improvement than the B6 group (between group d = 0.51, p < 0.05) in health-related quality of life. For those women (n = 28) who met criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), the DRSP ES were larger for those who had been in the micronutrient condition (ES = 1.28-1.67) as compared with those on B6 (ES = 0.50-0.75), although the group differences were not statistically reliable. There were no group differences in side effects, nor any serious adverse effects reported. Conclusions: Both treatments provided similar benefit for reducing PMS symptoms, with greater effect of micronutrients on quality of life as well as potential clinical benefit of micronutrients for PMDD. This study provides further efficacy data on B6 and also identifies the nutritionally broader spectrum intervention as possibly having specific advantages for those whose symptoms are more severe.

Results: The results demonstrated that the women with PMDD had a lower EL-phase estrogen level than the controls. Covariant analysis demonstrated that the interaction term between EL-phase estrogen and EL-phase progesterone level was associated with PMDD severity. Among women with lower EL estrogen levels, higher EL-phase progesterone was observed among the women with PMDD versus controls.

Sociodemographic, gynecological, and lifestyle variables, and PMS occurrence, were investigated among 642 students. The short form of the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL Bref) questionnaire was used to evaluate four domains of the quality of life of the students: physical, mental, social relationships, and environmental. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' criteria were used to define PMS.\nRESULTS:\nOf the 642 students, 49.9% had PMS, 23.3% had mild PMS and 26.6% had premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Most of the students were between 18 and 24 years old, had regular menstrual cycles, and practiced physical activity. Regarding the physical and mental domains of the WHOQOL-Bref questionnaire, a statistically significant difference was observed between the students who did not have and those who had mild or PMDD (p < 0.001). A difference was also found between the students who did not have PMS and those who had mild PMS in the social relationships (p = 0.001) and environmental domains (p = 0.009).\nCONCLUSION:\nMild PMS and PMDD are prevalent among university students on health-related courses, and the syndrome can affect the students' self-assessment of all the domains of quality of life.\nThieme Revinter Publicações Ltda Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."}, {"authors": ["Mizgier M", "Jarzabek-Bielecka G", "Jakubek E", "Kedzia W"], "topic": "Premenstrual Syndrome", "title": "The relationship between body mass index, body composition and premenstrual syndrome prevalence in girls.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.5603/GP.2019.0048", "publication": "Ginekol Pol. 2019;90(5):256-261. doi: 10.5603/GP.2019.0048.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nOBJECTIVES:\nPremenstrual Syndrome (PMS) is a cluster of physical and emotional symptoms occurring in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The study aim was to determine the relationship between PMS, and state of nutrition expressed as Body Mass Index (BMI) and body composition in 18-year-old females.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS:\nThe study was conducted on 476 women divided into two groups i.e. those suffering from PMS (n = 233) and those without symptoms (n = 243). The women were examined during their luteal phase using bioelectrical impedance analysis to determine their body composition. Height and weight were measured using digital medical scales with an electronic height rod. BMI was calculated thus: BMI = body mass (weight) (kg)/height (m2). The subjects were di- vided into two sub-groups: BMI < 25 kg/m2 and BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2. Statistical analysis was carried out using STATISTICA 10 PL software and the Mann-Whitney test.\nRESULTS:\nThe women with normal BMI suffered from PMS twice as often as the women with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 (68.2% vs. 31.8%). There were significantly higher values for Fat Mass (FM) (%) (p < 0.01) and FM (kg) (p < 0.001) in women without PMS, and significantly higher values for Fat-Free Mass (FFM) (%) (p < 0.001) and Total Body Water (TBW) (%) (p < 0.001) in women with PMS. Higher values were reported for FFM (kg) and TBW (kg) (p < 0.05) in girls with PMS and BMI ≥ 25.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThese results show PMS is more frequent in patients with BMI < 25, and less frequent in patients with higher FM (kg) and FM (%). Moreover, significant frequency of PMS was observed in patients with higher FFM and TBW. Such statistical significance was not confirmed in girls with a BMI < 25."}, {"authors": ["Abdollahi R", "Abiri B", "Sarbakhsh P", "Kashanian M", "Vafa M"], "topic": "Premenstrual Syndrome", "title": "The Effect of Vitamin D Supplement Consumption on Premenstrual Syndrome in Vitamin D-Deficient Young Girls: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1159/000500016", "publication": "Complement Med Res. 2019;26(5):336-342. doi: 10.1159/000500016.

Some studies demonstrated that vitamin D was associated with premenstrual symptoms.\nOBJECTIVE:\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of PMS in vitamin D-deficient young girls.\nMETHODS:\nIn this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 130 vitamin D-deficient girls aged 18-30 years, with PMS, were randomly divided into 2 groups and received a 2,000 IU vitamin D tablet (n = 64) or a placebo (n = 66) every other day for 12 weeks. At the beginning and at the end of week 12, serum 25(OH)-D, premenstrual symptoms, anthropometric indices, dietary intake, physical activity level, and sun exposure were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 20. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nRESULTS:\nSerum 25(OH)-D levels were significantly elevated in the vitamin D group in comparison to the placebo group after 12 weeks (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups with regard to 14 symptoms of PMS after 12 weeks of intervention, even after adjustment for the baseline values of anxiety, weeping, and hypersomnia (for all symptoms, p > 0.05). However, in the vitamin D group, scores of nervousness (p < 0.001), job activity reduction (p = 0.01), social activity reduction (p = 0.01), fatigue (p < 0.001), and physical symptoms (p = 0.00) were reduced at the end of the intervention, and these changes were statistically significant compared to baseline. However, these alterations did not reach significance compared with the placebo group (p > 0.05).\nCONCLUSION:\nIt seems that 2,000 IU vitamin D consumption in the vitamin D-deficient young girls with PMS every other day for 12 weeks had no significant impact on other PMS symptoms.\n© 2019 S.

Women with PMDD have a differential response to normal hormonal fluctuations. This susceptibility may involve the serotonin system, altered sensitivity of the GABAA receptor to the neurosteroid allopregnanalone, and altered brain circuitry involving emotional and cognitive functions. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors are considered the first-line treatment. Second-line treatments include oral contraceptives containing drospirenone, other ovulation suppression methods, calcium, chasteberry, and cognitive-behavioral therapy.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.
