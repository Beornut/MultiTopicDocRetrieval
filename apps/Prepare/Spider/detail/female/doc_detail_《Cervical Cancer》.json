This study tested if feeding and agonistic behaviors before calving were associated with the development of hyperketonemia (HYK) and metritis after calving. Holstein cows on 5 commercial farms were monitored for HYK (as identified using a cow-side β-hydroxybutyrate test) and metritis (using visual and olfactory assessment of vaginal discharge); both tests were conducted twice a week for 2 wk. Based on this assessment, we selected a balanced sample of cows that remained healthy (no signs of illness; n = 20), cows diagnosed with either HYK (n = 20) or metritis (n = 20), and cows with both HYK and metritis (n = 20). Video recordings from the 8 wk before calving (scored every 2 wk for 90 min immediately after fresh feed delivery) were used to evaluate feeding behavior and competition at the feed bunk. Feeding behavior before calving was associated with postpartum diagnosis of HYK and metritis. Specifically, cows that spent less time eating had higher odds of HYK and metritis. Odds of remaining healthy (compared with becoming sick with at least 1 condition) increased by 1.3 times for every additional 15 min spent eating. Additionally, cows that were involved in fewer agonistic interactions prepartum were more likely to be diagnosed with both conditions during the postpartum period. Odds of remaining healthy (compared with becoming sick with at least one condition) increased by 1.9 times for every 6 additional interactions. We conclude that prepartum feeding and agonistic behaviors can be used to identify animals at risk of HYK and metritis postpartum.\nCopyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

Although numerous studies have been performed to find the therapeutic agents for endometritis, the incidence of this disease remains high. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the major metabolic products of anaerobic bacteria fermentation in the gut, have been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effects and mechanisms of sodium butyrate (SB) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endometritis in mice. The mice were administered by intraperitoneal injection of SB at 1 h before LPS injection. 24 h later, the uterus tissues were collected. Hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) stained sections of uterus were used to determine the degree of the damage. Uterine myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was used to analyze neutrophil granulocytes concentration. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were measured by ELISA. The activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. The results showed that SB significantly attenuated the pathological injury of the uterus tissues. SB also suppressed LPS-induced MPO activity and the production of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β. Furthermore, Western blot analysis showed that SB inhibited the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway. In addition, SB could inhibit histone deacetylases. In summary, SB protects against LPS-induced endometritis through HDAC inhibition.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Rev-erbα, an important gene in the transcription-translation loop of circadian rhythm, is involved in regulating the balance between pro-inflammation and anti-inflammation. The disruption of this balance in human endometrial stroma cells (hESCs) destroys their biological behavior function in maintaining the menstrual cycle and embryonic implantation. Whether pharmacological modulation of Rev-erbα affects the inflammation of hESCs remains unclear. In this study, we treated hESCs with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and found that LPS treatment increased the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, and TNFα, and the secretion of IL-6. SR9009, a Rev-erbα agonist, significantly alleviated the LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in hESCs. Meanwhile, knockdown of Rev-erbα increased the expressions of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8, accompanied by an increased mRNA level of the core clock gene Bmal1. Western blot analysis showed that SR9009 inhibited the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the activation of NF-κB induced by LPS. All these findings suggested that pharmacological activation of Rev-erbα attenuated the LPS-induced inflammatory response of hESCs by suppressing TLR4-regulated NF-κB activation. This study may provide a strategy for preventing inflammation-related endometrial dysfunction and infertility or recurrent implantation failure.\n© The Author(s) 2019.

The incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) has increased due to the sexually active status of the young population. This leads to a more serious problem and a larger effect than previously observed. However, there have been few studies on this topic in Asian populations.\nAIM:\nWe aimed to evaluate the risk of preterm labor and/or ectopic pregnancy in Taiwanese women following PID.\nDESIGN:\nUsing the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database, we designed a retrospective cohort study that included 12- to 55-year-old pregnant women between 2000 and 2010. We selected a 1:3 age-matched control group of non-PID women. The endpoint was any episode of preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy; otherwise, the patients were tracked until 31 December 2010.\nMETHODS:\nThe risk factors for preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy were explored. For cases included from the index date until the end of 2010, we analyzed the risk of incident preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy. With the use of a multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, we calculated the hazard ratio (HR) with a 95% CI and compared it with that of the control group.\nRESULTS:\nThis study examined 30,450 patients with PID and 91,350 controls. During the follow-up period, patients in the PID group were more likely to develop preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy than patients in the control group. The cumulative incidence rates for developing preterm labor were 1.84% (561/30,450 individuals) in patients with PID and 1.63% (1492/91,350 individuals) in patients without PID. On the other hand, the cumulative incidence rate for developing ectopic pregnancy in patients with PID was 0.05% (14/30,450 individuals) but was only 0.04% (33/91,350 individuals) in patients without PID.

Although the incidence of postpartum endometritis is merely 1-5% after vaginal births, it remains the most common source of puerperal sepsis, contributing up to 15% of maternal mortality in low income countries. Geographically-remote centres in Malaysia prophylactically administer antibiotics for women with ragged placental membranes after vaginal birth, extrapolating evidence from retained placenta. We sought to clarify the rationale in continuing such practices.\nMETHODS:\nThis was an open-label, prospective, multicentre, randomized trial. Three hospitals where the current protocol was to administer prophylactic amoxycillin-clavulanic acid served as the sites of recruitment. Women who delivered vaginally beyond 24+ 0 weeks of gestation with ragged membranes were invited to participate in the trial and randomized into prophylaxis or expectant management with medical advice by blocks of 10, at a 1:1 ratio. A medication adherence diary was provided and patients followed up at 2 weeks and 6 weeks postpartum.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 6569 women gave birth vaginally in three centres during the trial period, of which 10.9% had ragged membranes. The incidence of endometritis was not significantly raised in women with or without prophylaxis (0.90% vs 0.29%; p = 0.60). All cases of endometritis presented within the first 2 weeks and preventive use of antibiotics did not ameliorate the severity of endometritis since rates of ICU admission, surgical evacuation and transfusion were comparable.\nCONCLUSION:\nPreventive use of antibiotics after vaginal delivery in women with ragged placental membranes did not result in a reduction of endometritis. Educating women on the signs and symptoms of endometritis would suffice. Based on the reported incidence of ragged membranes, a change in practice would result in 1500 less prescriptions of antibiotics per annum in these three centres.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION:\nNCT03459599 (Retrospectively registered on 9 March 2018).", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6624936/"}, {"references": null, "authors": ["Fouks Y", "Azem F", "Many A", "Cohen Y", "Levin I", "Cohen A"], "topic": "Pelvic Inflammatory Disease", "title": "Fertility outcomes in patients with tubo-ovarian abscesses after an oocyte retrieval: a longitudinal cohort analysis.", "publication": "Arch Gynecol Obstet. 2019 Sep;300(3):763-769. doi: 10.1007/s00404-019-05230-9.

Milk progesterone analysis was used to monitor reproductive cyclicity in 170 dairy cows across three different commercial herds.

The sequelae of chlamydia disproportionately impact women in terms of severity and cost. Untreated chlamydia progresses to pelvic inflammatory disease in 40% of cases, and is a leading cause of fallopian tube damage and pelvic adhesive disease resulting in ectopic pregnancy, tubal infertility, and acute and chronic pelvic pain. Tubal infertility is among the leading indications for in vitro fertilization (IVF) nationally and rates among couples undergoing IVF at military treatment centers are double the national average.

The most significant cause of post-partum infection is caesarean section; 20-25% of operations are followed by wound infections, endometritis or urinary tract infections. Approximately 13% of women in the UK undergo operative vaginal delivery (OVD) with forceps or vacuum, which is also associated with an increased risk of infection, estimated at 0.7%-16% of these deliveries. Despite this, previous reviews have identified only one small trial of antibiotic prophylaxis in 393 women and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the routine use of prophylactic antibiotics after OVD. The ANODE trial, a multicentre, blinded, placebo-controlled trial from the UK, is due to report findings from more than 3400 women in 2019 and will be the largest study to date of antibiotic prophylaxis following OVD.\nCopyright © 2018.

A standardized evaluation of the dermoscopic images was performed and the results were statistically analyzed.\nRESULTS:\nSixty-five lesions were included in the study, 22 (33.8%) of them MPD and 43 (66.2%) controls. The most frequent dermoscopic criteria of MPD were white scales (86.4%) and pink structureless areas (81.8%), followed by dotted vessels (72.7%), erosion/ulceration (68.2%) and white shiny lines (63.6%). The multivariate analysis showed that white scales and pink structureless areas were significant predictors of MPD, posing a 68-fold and a 31-fold probability of MPD, respectively. Split of the population into pigmented and non-pigmented lesions showed that in pigmented MPD, pink structureless areas, white lines and grey granules and dots are positive predictors of the disease. Among non-pigmented lesions, pink structureless areas, white lines, erosion/ulceration and white scales served as predictors of MPD.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThe most frequent profile of an individual with MPD is an elderly female with unilateral, asymptomatic, erythematous plaque of the nipple, dermoscopically displaying pink structureless areas, fine white scales, dotted and a few short linear vessels.

Patients who present with bloody nipple discharge with or without the presence of Paget's disease constitute one-third of all symptomatic in situ patients. Only rarely does an invasive cancer cause nipple discharge in the absence of a clinical mass. Even more obscure is the case of the invasive cancer involving solely the nipple-areolar complex. Sir James Paget first described 'an eczematous change in the skin of the nipple preceding an underlying mammary cancer' in 1874, which is now known as Paget's disease, considered to be ductal carcinoma in situ of the nipple-areolar region. There are two competing theories as to the pathogenesis of Paget's disease of the breast-one suggests that Pagetoid cells are keratinocytes that have undergone malignant transformation. According to this theory, Paget's disease of the breast represents an in situ carcinoma of the skin-and that overlying skin changes and underlying malignancy are discontinuous. The second theory suggests that cells migrate along basement membranes and enter the epidermis and dermis of the nipple-areola complex.

While melanoma (MM) of the NAC is exceedingly rare, benign lesions are more frequent but could be difficult to distinguish from MM. Besides MM, other malignant tumours can affect this area and in particular Paget's disease (PD). For clinically doubtful lesions, biopsy is required, with possible functional and aesthetic consequences in this sensitive area. Dermoscopy and reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) are widely used techniques for the diagnosis of many skin lesions, but their use for NAC lesions is not well established. The objective of this study was to evaluate current literature on these imaging techniques for NAC lesions. We searched in Medline, PubMed and Cochrane database all studies up to November 2018 dealing with dermoscopy, RCM and this special site. We found that the most described malignant tumour was PD and that only two primary MMs of the NAC have been reported with these imaging techniques. Although there are few data on diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive imaging techniques for NAC lesions, it seems that dermoscopy and RCM can add relevant information to be integrated with clinical examination for the diagnosis of NAC lesions and in particular for the differential diagnosis of PD and eczema.\n© 2019 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/jdv.15727"}, {"references": null, "authors": ["Arafah M", "Arain SA", "Raddaoui EMS", "Tulba A", "Alkhawaja FH", "Al Shedoukhy A"], "topic": "Breast Cancer", "title": "Molecular subtyping of mammary Paget's disease using immunohistochemistry.", "publication": "Saudi Med J. 2019 May;40(5):440-446. doi: 10.15537/smj.2019.5.23967.", "abstract": "Abstract\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo evaluate the molecular subtypes of Mammary Paget's disease (MPD) and the associated breast carcinomas.\nMETHODS:\nThis retrospective study was carried out at King Khalid University Hospital and King Faisal Specialist Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

A chi-square test was used to identify differences in categorical data among different groups. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, Cox proportional hazards models, sequential landmark analysis, and propensity score-matched analysis.\nRESULTS:\nThe study cohort included 5398 patients. Triple-negative BC accounted for the fewest patients with PD-only (1/22, 4.54%), Paget's disease-ductal carcinoma in situ (PD-DCIS) (3/48, 6.25%), and Paget's disease-invading ductal carcinoma (PD-IDC) (23/352, 6.53%).

At present, there is lack of clarity on PD's pathogenesis, the relationship between its subtypes, and its lineage link with the underlying invasive carcinomas. Here we describe that mammary PD and EMPD have similar mutational profiles, with the most frequent recurrent mutations occurring in the chromatin remodeling genes, such as KMT2C (MLL3, 39%) and ARID2 (22%), with additional recurrent somatic mutations detected in genes previously not known to be mutated in cancers, such as CDCC168 (34%), FSIP2 (29%), CASP8AP2 (29%), and BIRC6 (24%). In paired mammary PD and underlying breast carcinoma samples, distinct gene mutations were detected, indicating that they represent independent oncogenic events. Finally, multistage EMPD tissue sequencing revealed KMT2C gene occurring early in EMPD oncogenesis, and that multifocal EMPD samples share the same early gene mutations, suggesting clonal origin of multifocal EMPD. Our results reveal similar genomic landscapes between mammary PD and EMPD, including early aberrations in chromatin remodeling genes. In addition, mammary PD and underlying breast ductal carcinomas represent independent oncogenic events.

It is often overlooked and misdiagnosed as benign chronic eczema of the nipple. We aimed to retrospectively verify whether blood flow analysis using Doppler sonography was useful for detecting the presence of Paget disease.\nMETHODS:\nIn this retrospective study, 12 patients with pathologically proven unilateral nipple eczematous lesions (seven with Paget disease and five with simple dermatitis) were included. Nipple blood flow signal was observed using Doppler sonography, and the detected blood flow signals were quantified using digitally recorded images. Quantified blood flow ratio and pathologically examined capillary density were evaluated between affected and unaffected nipples. Findings of mammography, grayscale sonography, and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) were reviewed.\nRESULTS:\nIn patients with Paget disease, Doppler effects in the affected nipple were more clearly visible than those in the unaffected nipple. These effects were sufficiently visible to identify Paget disease. No obvious effects were observed in the affected and unaffected nipples of simple dermatitis. The quantified blood flow ratio and pathologically examined capillary density were significantly higher for the Paget lesion than those for the non-Paget lesion. The sensitivity of CE-MRI and Doppler sonography was markedly correlated, revealing blood flow changes in the nipple lesions of Paget disease.\nCONCLUSION:\nDoppler sonography visualized the proliferation of blood vessels in Paget lesions.

These identified patients included patients with PD (n = 469), patients with PD-IDC (n = 1832), and patients with PD-DCIS (n = 1130) and infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) (n = 498,076). Then, we compared the clinical characteristics of these patients with those who were diagnosed with IDC during the same period. The outcomes of these subtypes of breast carcinoma were different. Based on the overall survival, the patients with PD-IDC had the worst prognosis (5-year survival rate = 84.1%). The PD-DCIS had the best prognosis (5-year survival rate = 97.5%). Besides, among patients with Paget disease, the one who was married had a better prognosis than who were not. And, according to our research, the marital status was associated with the hormone receptor status in patients with PD-IDC. Among three subtypes of Paget disease, patients with PD-IDC had the worst prognosis. Besides, patients who were unmarried had worse outcomes. And the marital status of patients with PD-IDC is associated with hormone status. The observation underscores the importance of individualized treatment.\n© 2018 The Authors.

There are two anatomic subtypes: mammary (MPD) and extramammary (EMPD). Little is known about their molecular characteristics. Our objective was to discover novel molecular markers for PD and its subtypes. In the discovery phase, we used transcriptome analyses to uncover the most differentially expressed genes and pathways in EMPD biopsies compared with normal skin. In the validation phase, we performed immunohistochemistry analyses on the most promising marker (FOXA1) and other markers selected from a literature review (GATA3, estrogen receptor [ER], and androgen receptor [AR]) on independent biopsies of MPD (n = 86), EMPD (n = 59), and normal skin (n = 21). Transcriptome analyses revealed 210 genes differentially expressed more than 10-fold between EMPD and normal skin. These genes are involved in mammary and sweat gland development (FOXA1) and immune regulation, as well as epidermal differentiation. Immunohistochemistry staining revealed that FOXA1 was positive in 88% of both MPD and EMPD, whereas GATA3 was positive in 67% of MPD and 77% of EMPD, and ER was positive in 9% of MPD and 19% of EMPD. Finally, AR was positive in 33% of PD and 54% of EMPD. Mammary Paget's disease and EMPD share dysregulation of the glandular developmental regulator gene FOXA1, suggesting similarity in cell-specific transcriptional regulation. Further, FOXA1 may be a useful molecular target for developing PD therapies.\nCopyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, both cases were without Pagetoid extension or lymph node metastasis. The presently reported tumor consisted of irregularly shaped solid cell nests with delicate fibrovascular cores. The tumor cells had round nuclei with low-grade atypia and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Neuroendocrine differentiation was confirmed by immunohistochemical positivity for CD56, synaptophysin, and chromogranin A. Immunohistochemistry also confirmed the absence of myoepithelial cells around the tumor cell nests. Therefore, a diagnosis of invasive SPC was made. Additionally, tumor cell deposits in the intramammary and axillary lymph nodes were identified, and these deposits had the same histological characteristics as the invasive SPC of the nipple. The invasiveness of SPC can be difficult to determine. However, the tumor cell nests in the current case exhibited a retraction artifact, which is known to be associated with invasive carcinoma and a poor prognosis, as well as morphological patterns that have been previously identified as characteristic of invasive SPC.

We studied 51 cases of condyloma acuminatum of the urinary bladder from transurethral resections of the urinary bladder of 38 patients from the consult files of one of the authors. Transurethral resections of the urinary bladder were obtained from 25 males with a median age of 73 years (range: 41 to 87 y) and 13 females with a median age of 68 years (range: 30 to 86 y). The follow-up period ranged from 15 months to 20 years (median: 6 y). Bladder lesions were accompanied by urethral lesions in 4 men. Eight patients (8/38; 21.0%) had a history of immunosuppression. Seven patients (7/8; 87.5%) from this group had multiple and/or recurrent condylomas. One patient (1/38; 2.6%) with renal transplantation had 10 separate bladder condylomas over time. One patient (1/38; 2.6%) had extensive anogenital condylomas and anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3. One patient (1/8; 12.5%) with renal transplantation presented with a solitary condyloma with synchronous squamous cell carcinoma in situ. Three female patients (3/38; 7.9%) had a history of premalignant vagina/cervix lesions. In total, 17 patients (17/38; 44.7%) had squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder, either invasive or in situ. In all cases, the squamous cell carcinoma (either in situ or invasive) was diagnosed either concurrent with the diagnosis of bladder condyloma or within 1 year of the condyloma diagnosis). In total, 9 of 38 (23.7%) patients had invasive squamous cell carcinoma with or without in situ squamous cell carcinoma. Eight of 38 (21.0%) patients had squamous cell carcinoma in situ only (without a definitive invasive component-in 3 cases invasive squamous cell carcinoma could not be excluded with certainty). In total, 19 patients (19/38; 50%) were positive for either low-risk human papillomavirus (LR-HPV) or high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) or both (3 were positive for both LR-HPV and HR-HPV, 12 patients for only LR-HPV, and 4 for only HR-HPV). Of the 19 patients that were negative for both LR-HPV and HR-HPV, 9 of 19 (47.4%) patients had associated squamous cell carcinoma. Of the 12 patients with only LR-HPV, 4 (33.3%) had associated squamous cell carcinoma (either invasive or in situ). Of the 7 patients with HR-HPV (with or without LR-HPV), 4 (57.1%) has associated squamous cell carcinoma. In summary, condyloma acuminatum of the urinary bladder shows a strong association with squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder, regardless of the condyloma's HPV in situ hybridization results. Immunosuppression is associated with condylomas of the bladder. It is important to distinguish bladder condylomas from papillary urothelial carcinoma, given their different risks for panurothelial disease and risk of squamous cell carcinoma. Recognition of bladder condylomas histologically is often challenging given their rarity, and that they can be negative for both LR-HPV and HR-HPV. The lack of a history of other anogenital human papillomavirus-related lesions further increases the difficulty in establishing the correct diagnosis.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1097/PAS.0000000000001339"}, {"references": null, "authors": ["Yin G", "Li X", "Wang X", "Zhang H"], "topic": "Genital Warts", "title": "Effect of 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy on the expression of apoptosis inhibitors Bcl-2 and Survivin in keratinocytes of condyloma acuminatum.", "publication": "Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther. 2019 Dec;28:53-57. doi: 10.1016/j.pdpdt.2019.07.018.

There was a positive correlation between the expression of Bcl-2 and Survivin in condyloma acuminatum tissues after 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (r = 0.480, P <  0.05).\nCONCLUSION:\n5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy may promote apoptosis of condyloma acuminatum cells by reducing the expression of Bcl-2 and Survivin, suggesting that this is potentially one of the molecular mechanisms of 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy in the treatment of condyloma acuminatum.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of the analysis was evaluating what impact PDT treatment had on their pregnancies and delivery.\nMETHODS:\n10 patients (22-32 years of age, 25.5 years of age on average) were treated with PDT in 2007-2014. 2 patients suffered from squamous cell hyperplasia, 2 patients from vulvar lichen sclerosus, 1 - genital warts, 1 - VIN I (current terminology: LSIL/Flat condyloma), 2 - CIN III (HSIL), 2 - CIN I (LSIL). The patients underwent photodynamic therapy (PDT). In the course of PDT the 5% 5- aminolevulinic acid was used in gel form three hours before irradiation. The affected areas were irradiated with a halogen lamp PhotoDyn 501 (590-760 nm) during a 10-min radiation treatment. The treatment was repeated weekly for 10 weeks.\nRESULTS:\nThe median observation time period between the end of therapy and delivery was 3.92 years (2-7 years). None of the patients suffered from infertility. All patients gave birth to healthy, full-term infants. In case of one pregnancy cervical cerclage was needed. Two patients were treated for hypothyroidism caused by the Hashimoto disease. One patient had gestational diabetes. Two patients had already given birth to 2 children. Five patients gave birth by caesarean section.\nCONCLUSION:\nTopical PDT selectively used for treating the diseases of the female reproductive organs was applied in our group of patients and proved to be a safe method. It had no apparent negative impact on female fertility and allowed these women to give birth to healthy children.\nCopyright © 2019.

Epub 2019 Jun 26.", "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nMore than 10 years have elapsed since human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination was implemented. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of the population-level impact of vaccinating girls and women against human papillomavirus on HPV infections, anogenital wart diagnoses, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+ (CIN2+) to summarise the most recent evidence about the effectiveness of HPV vaccines in real-world settings and to quantify the impact of multiple age-cohort vaccination.\nMETHODS:\nIn this updated systematic review and meta-analysis, we used the same search strategy as in our previous paper. We searched MEDLINE and Embase for studies published between Feb 1, 2014, and Oct 11, 2018. Studies were eligible if they compared the frequency (prevalence or incidence) of at least one HPV-related endpoint (genital HPV infections, anogenital wart diagnoses, or histologically confirmed CIN2+) between pre-vaccination and post-vaccination periods among the general population and if they used the same population sources and recruitment methods before and after vaccination. Our primary assessment was the relative risk (RR) comparing the frequency (prevalence or incidence) of HPV-related endpoints between the pre-vaccination and post-vaccination periods. We stratified all analyses by sex, age, and years since introduction of HPV vaccination. We used random-effects models to estimate pooled relative risks.\nFINDINGS:\nWe identified 1702 potentially eligible articles for this systematic review and meta-analysis, and included 65 articles in 14 high-income countries: 23 for HPV infection, 29 for anogenital warts, and 13 for CIN2+. After 5-8 years of vaccination, the prevalence of HPV 16 and 18 decreased significantly by 83% (RR 0·17, 95% CI 0·11-0·25) among girls aged 13-19 years, and decreased significantly by 66% (RR 0·34, 95% CI 0·23-0·49) among women aged 20-24 years. The prevalence of HPV 31, 33, and 45 decreased significantly by 54% (RR 0·46, 95% CI 0·33-0·66) among girls aged 13-19 years. Anogenital wart diagnoses decreased significantly by 67% (RR 0·33, 95% CI 0·24-0·46) among girls aged 15-19 years, decreased significantly by 54% (RR 0·46, 95% CI 0.36-0.60) among women aged 20-24 years, and decreased significantly by 31% (RR 0·69, 95% CI 0·53-0·89) among women aged 25-29 years. Among boys aged 15-19 years anogenital wart diagnoses decreased significantly by 48% (RR 0·52, 95% CI 0·37-0·75) and among men aged 20-24 years they decreased significantly by 32% (RR 0·68, 95% CI 0·47-0·98). After 5-9 years of vaccination, CIN2+ decreased significantly by 51% (RR 0·49, 95% CI 0·42-0·58) among screened girls aged 15-19 years and decreased significantly by 31% (RR 0·69, 95% CI 0·57-0·84) among women aged 20-24 years.\nINTERPRETATION:\nThis updated systematic review and meta-analysis includes data from 60 million individuals and up to 8 years of post-vaccination follow-up. Our results show compelling evidence of the substantial impact of HPV vaccination programmes on HPV infections and CIN2+ among girls and women, and on anogenital warts diagnoses among girls, women, boys, and men.

Autophagy plays an important role in maintaining internal environmental stability. However, the role of autophagy regulation in the anogenital warts caused by HPV infection remains unknown.\nOBJECTIVE:\nA multigroup case-control study was designed to identify the autophagy gene fingerprint involved in anogenital warts arising from infections with different HPV genotypes.\nMETHODS:\nHuman autophagy PCR arrays were performed on the initial 18 participants grouped by their different HPV genotypes for gene expression-profiling analysis. The negative control was skin samples collected during plastic surgery on the chest from a group of individuals who showed none of the clinical symptoms or evidence of HPV infection. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to validate the microarray results in another 24 individuals.\nRESULTS:\nOut of 84 genes involved in autophagy, different autophagic responses were found among the 29 genes that encode autophagy machinery components, and expression levels of 13 of these genes were downregulated. Finally, we verified that the expression levels of 2 key genes that participate in the formation of autophagosomes, ATG3 and -BECLIN1, were downregulated in the HPV infection groups independently of genotype compared with the control group.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThese findings showed that HPV infection downregulated the expression of ATGs in CA. Additionally, there were no differences in the expression of ATGs between the different HPV genotype infection groups.

Medical therapy for AV in preadolescents has not been well studied. We explore the efficacy and safety profile of sinecatechins 15% ointment and imiquimod 5% cream in the treatment of AV, alone and in combination therapy with other commonly used medications.\nMETHODS:\nA single-institution, retrospective review of children under 12 years of age with AV treated with imiquimod 5% cream and sinecatechins 15% ointment was performed. Demographic data, side effects, and outcomes of therapy were recorded for each patient, and overall efficacy was determined.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 37 patients met inclusion criteria. Responses were seen in 8 out of 9 patients treated with sinecatechins 15% ointment (5 full, 3 partial, and 1 no response) and 9 out of 17 patients treated with imiquimod 5% cream (4 full, 5 partial, and 8 no response). Combination therapy with one or more of the following treatments (podophyllin, cimetidine, candida antigen injection, and HPV vaccine) were evaluated, but no combination was objectively superior to the others. No significant difference was found in overall efficacy between sinecatechins and imiquimod. Side effects were mild and limited to irritation and erythema.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nBoth imiquimod 5% cream and sinecatechins 15% ointment are moderately effective in the treatment of AV in preadolescent children, with a trend toward greater effectiveness of sinecatechins. Combination therapy with other treatments did not significantly increase the effectiveness of topical therapies. Each modality has a tolerable side effect profile with a low risk of serious complications.\n© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/pde.13881"}, {"references": null, "authors": ["Zeng J", "Qu P", "Hu Y", "Sun P", "Qi J", "Zhao G", "Gao Y"], "topic": "Cervical Cancer", "title": "Clinicopathological risk factors in the light of the revised 2018 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging system for early cervical cancer with staging IB: A single center retrospective study.", "publication": "Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Apr;99(16):e19714. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000019714.", "abstract": "Abstract\nTo validate the revised 2018 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system for cervical cancer on the survival of patients who underwent radical hysterectomy for 2009 FIGO stage IB carcinomas.We retrospectively identified and reviewed 251 patients treated with radical hysterectomy for 2009 FIGO stage IB cervical carcinomas from January 2011 to December 2016.

Colposcopy-directed tumor biopsies were confirmed by histology and used for genomic DNA extraction. The Roche Linear Array HPV genotyping test was used for HPV genotyping. Peripheral whole blood was used for HIV-1 rapid testing. Fully automated FC500MPL/CellMek with PanLeucogate (PLG) was used to determine absolute CD4 count, CD4 percentage, and CD45 count. Chi-squared test, a logistic regression model, parametric Pearson correlation, and ROC curves were used for statistical analyses. We used the Benjamini-Horchberg test to control for false discovery rate (FDR, q-value). All tests were significant when both P and q were <.05.Age was a significant predictor for invasive cervical cancer (ICC) in both HIV-1-seronegative (P < .0001, q < 0.0001) and HIV-1-positive women (P = .0003, q = 0.0003). Sixty eight percent (59/87) of HIV-1-positive women with different stages of cervical disease presented with a CD4 percentage equal or less than 28%, and a median absolute CD4 count of 400 cells/μl (IQR 300-500 cells/μl). Of the HIV-1-positive women, 75% (30/40) with ICC, possessed ≤28% CD4 cells vs 25% (10/40) who possessed >28% CD4 cells (both P < .001, q < 0.001). Furthermore, 70% (28/40) of women with ICC possessed CD4 count >350 compared to 30% (12/40) who possessed CD4 count ≤ 350 (both P < .001, q < 0.001).Age is an independent predictor for ICC. In turn, development of ICC in HIV-1-positive women is independent of the host CD4 cells and associates with low CD4 percentage regardless of absolute CD4 count that falls within the normal range. Thus, using CD4 percentage may add a better prognostic indicator of cervical disease stage than absolute CD4 count alone.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000019273"}, {"references": null, "authors": ["Lupi LA", "Cucielo MS", "Silveira HS", "Gaiotte LB", "Cesário RC", "Seiva FRF", "de Almeida Chuffa LG"], "topic": "Cervical Cancer", "title": "The role of Toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathway in ovarian, cervical, and endometrial cancers.", "publication": "Life Sci. 2020 Apr 15;247:117435. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117435.

Among all subtypes, the TLR4 is a highly described transmembrane protein involved in the inflammatory process. The TLR4/myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) signaling pathway has been implicated in oncogenic events in several tissues and is associated with survival of patients. Through activation, TLR4 recruits adaptor proteins, i.e., MyD88 or TRIF, to triggers canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways that result in distinct immune responses. In most cancer cells, uncontrolled TLR4 signaling modifies the tumor microenvironment to proliferate and evade immune surveillance. By contrast, TLR4 activation can produce antitumor activities, thereby inhibiting tumor growth and enhancing the proper immune response. We review herein recent approaches on the role of the TLR4 signaling pathway and discuss potential candidates for gynecological cancer therapies; among these agents, natural and synthetic compounds have been tested both in vitro and in vivo. Since TLR4 ligands have been investigated as effective immune-adjuvants in the context of these aggressive malignancies, we described how TLR4 signaling controls part of the tumor-related inflammatory process and which are the new targeting molecules implicated in the regulation of tumorigenicity in ovarian, cervical, and endometrial cancers.\nCopyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Patients receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy routinely experience several side effects including toxicity, non-targeted damage of tissues, hair loss, neurotoxicity, multidrug resistance (MDR), nausea, anemia and neutropenia. Phytochemicals can interfere with almost every stage of carcinogenesis to prevent cancer development. Many natural compounds are known to activate/deactivate multiple redox-sensitive transcription factors that modulate tumor signaling pathways. Polyphenols have been found to be promising agents against cervical cancer. However, applications of phytochemicals as a therapeutic drug are limited due to low oral bioavailability, poor aqueous solubility and requirement of high doses. Nano-sized phytochemicals (NPCs) are promising anti-cancer agents as they are required in minute quantities which lowers overall treatment costs. Several phytochemicals, including quercetin, lycopene, leutin, curcumin, green tea polyphenols and others have been packaged as nanoparticles and proven to be useful in nano-chemoprevention and nano-chemotherapy. Nanoparticles have high biocompatibility, biodegradability and stability in biological environment. Nano-scale drug delivery systems are excellent source for enhanced drug specificity, improved absorption rates, reduced drug degradation and systemic toxicity.

Epub 2020 Jan 30.", "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nWHO is developing a global strategy towards eliminating cervical cancer as a public health problem, which proposes an elimination threshold of four cases per 100 000 women and includes 2030 triple-intervention coverage targets for scale-up of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination to 90%, twice-lifetime cervical screening to 70%, and treatment of pre-invasive lesions and invasive cancer to 90%. We assessed the impact of achieving the 90-70-90 triple-intervention targets on cervical cancer mortality and deaths averted over the next century. We also assessed the potential for the elimination initiative to support target 3.4 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)-a one-third reduction in premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by 2030.\nMETHODS:\nThe WHO Cervical Cancer Elimination Modelling Consortium (CCEMC) involves three independent, dynamic models of HPV infection, cervical carcinogenesis, screening, and precancer and invasive cancer treatment. Reductions in age-standardised rates of cervical cancer mortality in 78 low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) were estimated for three core scenarios: girls-only vaccination at age 9 years with catch-up for girls aged 10-14 years; girls-only vaccination plus once-lifetime screening and cancer treatment scale-up; and girls-only vaccination plus twice-lifetime screening and cancer treatment scale-up. Vaccination was assumed to provide 100% lifetime protection against infections with HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, and to scale up to 90% coverage in 2020. Cervical screening involved HPV testing at age 35 years, or at ages 35 years and 45 years, with scale-up to 45% coverage by 2023, 70% by 2030, and 90% by 2045, and we assumed that 50% of women with invasive cervical cancer would receive appropriate surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy by 2023, which would increase to 90% by 2030. We summarised results using the median (range) of model predictions.\nFINDINGS:\nIn 2020, the estimated cervical cancer mortality rate across all 78 LMICs was 13·2 (range 12·9-14·1) per 100 000 women. Compared to the status quo, by 2030, vaccination alone would have minimal impact on cervical cancer mortality, leading to a 0·1% (0·1-0·5) reduction, but additionally scaling up twice-lifetime screening and cancer treatment would reduce mortality by 34·2% (23·3-37·8), averting 300 000 (300 000-400 000) deaths by 2030 (with similar results for once-lifetime screening). By 2070, scaling up vaccination alone would reduce mortality by 61·7% (61·4-66·1), averting 4·8 million (4·1-4·8) deaths. By 2070, additionally scaling up screening and cancer treatment would reduce mortality by 88·9% (84·0-89·3), averting 13·3 million (13·1-13·6) deaths (with once-lifetime screening), or by 92·3% (88·4-93·0), averting 14·6 million (14·1-14·6) deaths (with twice-lifetime screening). By 2120, vaccination alone would reduce mortality by 89·5% (86·6-89·9), averting 45·8 million (44·7-46·4) deaths. By 2120, additionally scaling up screening and cancer treatment would reduce mortality by 97·9% (95·0-98·0), averting 60·8 million (60·2-61·2) deaths (with once-lifetime screening), or by 98·6% (96·5-98·6), averting 62·6 million (62·1-62·8) deaths (with twice-lifetime screening). With the WHO triple-intervention strategy, over the next 10 years, about half (48% [45-55]) of deaths averted would be in sub-Saharan Africa and almost a third (32% [29-34]) would be in South Asia; over the next 100 years, almost 90% of deaths averted would be in these regions. For premature deaths (age 30-69 years), the WHO triple-intervention strategy would result in rate reductions of 33·9% (24·4-37·9) by 2030, 96·2% (94·3-96·8) by 2070, and 98·6% (96·9-98·8) by 2120.\nINTERPRETATION:\nThese findings emphasise the importance of acting immediately on three fronts to scale up vaccination, screening, and treatment for pre-invasive and invasive cervical cancer. In the next 10 years, a one-third reduction in the rate of premature mortality from cervical cancer in LMICs is possible, contributing to the realisation of the 2030 UN SDGs. Over the next century, successful implementation of the WHO elimination strategy would reduce cervical cancer mortality by almost 99% and save more than 62 million women's lives.\nFUNDING:\nWHO, UNDP, UN Population Fund, UNICEF-WHO-World Bank Special Program of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction, Germany Federal Ministry of Health, National Health and Medical Research Council Australia, Centre for Research Excellence in Cervical Cancer Control, Canadian Institute of Health Research, Compute Canada, and Fonds de recherche du Québec-Santé.\nCopyright © 2020 The Author(s).

Epub 2020 Jan 30.", "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nThe WHO Director-General has issued a call for action to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem. To help inform global efforts, we modelled potential human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and cervical screening scenarios in low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) to examine the feasibility and timing of elimination at different thresholds, and to estimate the number of cervical cancer cases averted on the path to elimination.\nMETHODS:\nThe WHO Cervical Cancer Elimination Modelling Consortium (CCEMC), which consists of three independent transmission-dynamic models identified by WHO according to predefined criteria, projected reductions in cervical cancer incidence over time in 78 LMICs for three standardised base-case scenarios: girls-only vaccination; girls-only vaccination and once-lifetime screening; and girls-only vaccination and twice-lifetime screening. Girls were vaccinated at age 9 years (with a catch-up to age 14 years), assuming 90% coverage and 100% lifetime protection against HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. Cervical screening involved HPV testing once or twice per lifetime at ages 35 years and 45 years, with uptake increasing from 45% (2023) to 90% (2045 onwards). The elimination thresholds examined were an average age-standardised cervical cancer incidence of four or fewer cases per 100 000 women-years and ten or fewer cases per 100 000 women-years, and an 85% or greater reduction in incidence. Sensitivity analyses were done, varying vaccination and screening strategies and assumptions. We summarised results using the median (range) of model predictions.\nFINDINGS:\nGirls-only HPV vaccination was predicted to reduce the median age-standardised cervical cancer incidence in LMICs from 19·8 (range 19·4-19·8) to 2·1 (2·0-2·6) cases per 100 000 women-years over the next century (89·4% [86·2-90·1] reduction), and to avert 61·0 million (60·5-63·0) cases during this period. Adding twice-lifetime screening reduced the incidence to 0·7 (0·6-1·6) cases per 100 000 women-years (96·7% [91·3-96·7] reduction) and averted an extra 12·1 million (9·5-13·7) cases. Girls-only vaccination was predicted to result in elimination in 60% (58-65) of LMICs based on the threshold of four or fewer cases per 100 000 women-years, in 99% (89-100) of LMICs based on the threshold of ten or fewer cases per 100 000 women-years, and in 87% (37-99) of LMICs based on the 85% or greater reduction threshold. When adding twice-lifetime screening, 100% (71-100) of LMICs reached elimination for all three thresholds. In regions in which all countries can achieve cervical cancer elimination with girls-only vaccination, elimination could occur between 2059 and 2102, depending on the threshold and region. Introducing twice-lifetime screening accelerated elimination by 11-31 years. Long-term vaccine protection was required for elimination.\nINTERPRETATION:\nPredictions were consistent across our three models and suggest that high HPV vaccination coverage of girls can lead to cervical cancer elimination in most LMICs by the end of the century. Screening with high uptake will expedite reductions and will be necessary to eliminate cervical cancer in countries with the highest burden.\nFUNDING:\nWHO, UNDP, UN Population Fund, UNICEF-WHO-World Bank Special Program of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction, Canadian Institute of Health Research, Fonds de recherche du Québec-Santé, Compute Canada, National Health and Medical Research Council Australia Centre for Research Excellence in Cervical Cancer Control.\nCopyright © 2020 The Author(s).

There is an authentic dilemma between patient's frailty, residual life expectancy and the toll that take anticancer treatments. Since elder patients are almost always excluded from clinical trials, it is hard to get robust scientific data on the tolerability of oncologic treatments and to set in place recommendations. Cervix cancer is traditionally diagnosed in younger women but it has a 2nd incidence peak between 60 and 70 years old. Cervix cancer in elder patients is a subject to many questions in terms of screening and is a therapeutic challenge. This article reviews literature data on these different aspects, from screening to surgery, from radiotherapy to brachytherapy, from chemotherapy to supportive care, from immunotherapy to geriatric assessment. We tried to show how modern therapeutic innovations may benefit elder patients. Expected benefits in terms of efficacy and toxicity may overcome the long-lasting tendency to undertreatment in elder patients and improve their quality of life after cancer treatment. In 2020, there seems to be less and less reasons justifying that elder women with cervix cancer may not receive the appropriate treatment.\nCopyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
