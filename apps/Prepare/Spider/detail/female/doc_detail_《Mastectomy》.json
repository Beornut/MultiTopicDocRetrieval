This meta-analysis is designed to examine the clinical analgesic efficacy of Pecs block in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery.\nMETHODS:\nAn electronic literature search of the Library of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases was conducted to collect randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from inception to November 2018. These RCTs compared the effect of Pecs block in combination with general anesthesia (GA) to GA alone in mastectomy surgery. Pain scores, intraoperative and postoperative opioid consumption, time to first request for analgesia, and incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting were analyzed.\nRESULTS:\nThirteen RCTs with 940 patients were included in our analysis. The use of Pecs block significantly reduced pain scores in the postanesthesia care unit (weighted mean difference [WMD] = -1.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.90 to -0.91; P < .001) and at 24 hours after surgery (WMD = -1.01; 95% CI, -1.64 to -0.38; P < .001). Moreover, Pecs block decreased postoperative opioid consumption in the postanesthesia care unit (WMD = -1.93; 95% CI, -3.51 to -0.34; P = .017) and at 24 hours (WMD = -11.88; 95% CI, -15.50 to -8.26; P < .001). Pecs block also reduced intraoperative opioid consumption (WMD = -85.52; 95% CI, -121.47 to -49.56; P < .001) and prolonged the time to first analgesic request (WMD = 296.69; 95% CI, 139.91-453.48; P < .001).

Breast prosthesis can improve patient's figure externally, increase self-confidence, thus improving quality of life (QOL). Prospective study of different breast prostheses has not yet been performed in China. Our objective was to evaluate the QOL of patients wearing different types of breast prostheses and to compare the physical and psychological effects of different temperature-controlled breast prostheses on patients.\nMETHODS:\nThirty patients with breast cancer were recruited through the Yankang E-follow-up Platform at the Department of Breast Surgery of Fudan University, Shanghai Cancer Center and were randomized into either intervention or control group. Random number tables were used in this study for randomization. In the first 6 weeks of the study, self-adhesive breast prostheses and conventional breast prostheses had been used in the intervention and control group, respectively. In the later 6 weeks, the breast prostheses used were switched into another kind. Several dimensional parameters including skin conditions, breast prosthesis knowledge, breast prosthesis knowledge, QOL, and body image were examined by different questionnaires in the end of both 6th and 12th week.\nRESULTS:\nThere were no significant difference in QOL and body image between the 2 groups during 6th and 12th week. At the 6th week of the study, patients of the intervention group preferred to the self-adhesive breast prosthesis, indicating that the self-adhesive breast prosthesis seemed more likely to feel like part of their body, while prosthesis cleaning remaining their biggest concern. At the end of 12th week, in comparison with the number at 6th week, more patients in both groups were willing to choose self-adhesive breast prosthesis.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nWe conclude that women are satisfied with the temperature-controlled breast prosthesis and are more willing to choose self-adhesive breast prostheses although cleaning remains a problem. In China, patients still lack information about breast prostheses. Therefore, specialist breast nurses should provide comprehensive information about breast prostheses, assist patients in selecting suitable breast prostheses, collect feedback about the prostheses, and reduce each patient's physical and mental discomfort."}, {"authors": ["Qiu H", "Xu WH", "Kong J", "Ding XJ", "Chen DF"], "topic": "Mastectomy", "title": "Effect of breast-conserving surgery and modified radical mastectomy on operation index, symptom checklist-90 score and prognosis in patients with early breast cancer.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000019279", "publication": "Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Mar;99(11):e19279. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000019279.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nThe present study aims to analyze the effects of breast-conserving surgery and modified radical mastectomy on operation indexes, Symptom checklist-90 scores and prognosis in patients with early breast cancer.The clinical data of 128 patients with breast cancer who were treated in our hospital from May 2015 to May 2016 were included into the analysis.

Quantification of lymphatic contractility has previously been shown using a custom-built near-infrared imaging system. However, to broaden the clinical use of functional lymphatic measurements, these measurements need to be performed using a standard-of-care, clinically available camera. The authors propose an objective, algorithmic, and clinically accessible approach to quantify lymphatic contractility using a 3-minute indocyanine green lymphangiograph recorded with a commercially available near-infrared camera. A retrospective review of the authors' indocyanine green lymphangiography video repository maintained in a Research Electronic Data Capture database was performed. All patients with a newly diagnosed unilateral breast cancer undergoing preoperative indocyanine green lymphangiography were included in the analysis. Patient medical records were then analyzed for patient demographics, and videos were analyzed for contractility. Seventeen consecutive patients with unilateral breast cancers underwent video processing to quantify lymphatic contractility of the ipsilateral extremity in contractions per minute. All patients were women, with an average age of 60.5 years (range, 38 to 84 years). The average lymphatic contractility rate was 1.13 contractions per minute (range, 0.67 to 2.5 contractions per minute). Using a clinically accessible standard-of-care device for indocyanine green lymphangiography, the authors were able to determine lymphatic contractility rates of a normal extremity. The authors' finding falls within the range of previously published data quantifying lymphatic contractility using a research device, suggesting that the authors' technique provides a clinically accessible, time-effective means of assessing lymphatic contractility.

Costs were retrieved from supplier price lists, physician fee schedules, lymphedema therapists, and literature reviews. The net present value of all costs incurred for each clinical pathway were calculated.\nRESULTS:\nThe estimated net present value of all costs for a patient with breast cancer-related lymphedema undergoing treatment were as follows: (1) complete decongestive therapy alone ($30,400); (2) lymphovenous bypass no longer requiring ongoing complete decongestive therapy ($15,000); or (3) lymphovenous bypass requiring ongoing complete decongestive therapy ($42,100). The expected net present value of all costs for lymphovenous bypass was $26,800, which was comparable to that of complete decongestive therapy alone. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the expected net present value of lymphovenous bypass was dependent on the patient's life expectancy, number of bypass anastomoses, and likelihood of discontinuing complete decongestive therapy.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nLymphedema has substantial ongoing costs irrespective of the treatment modality. The cost of lymphovenous bypass appears comparable to that of complete decongestive therapy alone-the surgical costs of lymphovenous bypass are offset by the savings from discontinued ongoing therapy. Despite its limitations as a theoretical economic model, this study provides insight into the potential economic impact of lymphovenous bypass."}, {"authors": ["Teotia SS", "Venutolo C", "Haddock NT"], "topic": "Mastectomy", "title": "Outcomes in Patients Receiving Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Undergoing Immediate Breast Reconstruction: Effect of Timing, Postoperative Complications, and Delay to Radiation Therapy.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1097/PRS.0000000000006112", "publication": "Plast Reconstr Surg. 2019 Nov;144(5):732e-742e. doi: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000006112.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy is offered to many patients with breast cancer. In patients undergoing mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction, there is concern that this treatment could increase postoperative complications. The authors characterize which patients are at a higher risk of experiencing a postoperative complication, and assess the impact of postoperative complications on timing of radiation treatment.\nMETHODS:\nA retrospective review was performed on patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction using tissue expanders. Multivariable binomial logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for experiencing a postoperative complication. Independent samples t tests were used to compare means for neoadjuvant chemotherapy timing and time to commencement of radiation therapy between patients with and without complications.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 128 patients were identified. Patients that experienced a complication had a statistically significant difference in time to commencement of radiation therapy (p = 0.021) and an elevated body mass index (p = 0.018) compared with patients who experienced no complication; there was no difference in timing interval of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.692). Logistic regression showed an associate between body mass index and postoperative complication (OR, 1.09; 95 percent CI, 1.018 to 1.167; p = 0.013).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nPostoperative complications delay the commencement of radiation therapy in patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and undergo mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction. The period from the last dose of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was equivalent between those that experienced postoperative complications and those that did not. Patients with a higher body mass index are more likely to experience postoperative complications, and this should be considered when offering tissue expanders to obese patients who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and require adjuvant radiation treatment.\nCLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:\nRisk, III."}, {"authors": ["Lee YS", "Lee HS", "Chang SW", "Lee CU", "Kim JS", "Jung YK", "Kim JH", "Seo YS", "Yim HJ", "Lee CH", "Woo SU", "Seo JH", "Yeon JE", "Um SH", "Byun KS"], "topic": "Mastectomy", "title": "Underlying nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a significant factor for breast cancer recurrence after curative surgery.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6775430/", "publication": "Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Sep;98(39):e17277. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000017277.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nBreast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, and it is a main cause of death in women. As with breast cancer, metabolic components are important risk factors for the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of NAFLD in patients with breast cancer and the impact of NAFLD on the prognosis of breast cancer.Patients with breast cancer were enrolled in the study from January 2007 to June 2017. Hepatic steatosis was evaluated through non-enhanced computed tomography scan by measuring Hounsfield Units in the liver and spleen, respectively; 123 healthy controls who underwent non-enhanced computed tomography scan were also analyzed.The prevalence of NAFLD in patients with breast cancer was 15.8% (251/1587), which was significantly higher than in healthy controls (8.9%, 11/123) (P = .036). Overall survival did not significantly differ between the groups with and without NAFLD (P = .304). However, recurrence-free survival was significantly higher in patients without NAFLD than in those with NAFLD (P = .009). Among breast cancer patients receiving endocrine treatment, the NAFLD group showed a higher cumulative incidence of significant liver injury than the group without NAFLD (P < .001).The prevalence of NAFLD in patients with breast cancer is significantly higher than in healthy controls. Moreover, breast cancer patients with NAFLD showed poorer prognosis in terms of recurrence. Therefore, diagnostic evaluation for NALFD is important in managing patients with breast cancer."}, {"authors": ["Kamali P", "van Bommel A", "Becherer B", "Cooter R", "Mureau MAM", "Pusic A", "Siesling S", "van der Hulst RRJW", "Lin SJ", "Rakhorst H"], "topic": "Mastectomy", "title": "Immediate Breast Reconstruction in The Netherlands and the United States: A Proof-of-Concept to Internationally Compare Quality of Care Using Cancer Registry Data.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1097/PRS.0000000000006011", "publication": "Plast Reconstr Surg. 2019 Oct;144(4):565e-574e. doi: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000006011.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nStudies based on large-volume databases have made significant contributions to research on breast cancer surgery. To date, no comparison between large-volume databases has been made internationally. This is the first proof-of-concept study exploring the feasibility of combining two existing operational databases of The Netherlands and the United States, focusing on breast cancer care and immediate breast reconstruction specifically.313/291 METHODS:: The National Breast Cancer Organization The Netherlands Breast Cancer Audit (NBCA) (2011 to 2015) and the U.S. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (2010 to 2013) were compared on structure and content. Data variables were grouped into general, treatment-specific, cancer-specific, and follow-up variables and were matched. As proof-of-concept, mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction rates in patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ were analyzed.\nRESULTS:\nThe NBCA included 115 variables and SEER included 112. The NBCA included significantly more treatment-specific variables (n = 46 versus 6), whereas the SEER database included more cancer-specific variables (n = 74 versus 26). In patients diagnosed with breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ, immediate breast reconstruction was performed in 19.3 percent and 24.0 percent of the breast cancer cohort and 44.0 percent and 35.3 percent of the ductal carcinoma in situ cohort in the NBCA and SEER, respectively. Immediate breast reconstruction rates increased significantly over time in both data sets.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThis study provides a first overview of available registry data on breast cancer care in The Netherlands and the United States, and revealed limited data on treatment in the United States. Comparison of treatment patterns of immediate breast reconstruction showed interesting differences. The authors advocate the urgency for an international database with alignment of (treatment) variables to improve quality of breast cancer care for patients across the globe."}, {"authors": ["Najeeb HN", "Mehdi SR", "Siddiqui AM", "Batool SK"], "topic": "Mastectomy", "title": "Pectoral Nerves I, II and Serratus Plane Blocks in Multimodal Analgesia for Mastectomy: A Randomised Clinical Trial.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.29271/jcpsp.2019.10.910", "publication": "J Coll Physicians Surg Pak. 2019 Oct;29(10):910-914. doi: 10.29271/jcpsp.2019.10.910.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo primarily assess pain score in first 24 hours in PECS (PECtoral Serratus) block group undergoing mastectomy; secondary objective was to observe opioid and antiemetic consumption in the postoperative period.\nSTUDY DESIGN:\nObserver-blinded randomised control trial.\nPLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY:\nDepartment of Anesthesiology, Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital Lahore (SKMCH), from February to December 2017.\nMETHODOLOGY:\nOne hundred and twenty patients of more than 18 years, ASA I and II, planned for unilateral elective modified radical mastectomy under general anesthesia, were scheduled randomly to receive either general anesthesia plus PECS block (n = 60) or general anesthesia alone (n = 60).

Initial doubts over the efficacy and safety of PMRT in these patients were partially overcome by improvement in technology and systemic treatments. Several randomized controlled clinical trials confirmed benefit of PMRT in N1 patients, which were meta-analyzed by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG). This meta-analysis provides the sole high-level evidence to guide clinical decision-making. PRESENT: Nevertheless, concerns have been evoked around these results, most notably concerning the patient selection bias and the era in which the patients were treated. More recent studies, albeit retrospective, are in contrast with this level I evidence, unequivocally reporting inferior recurrence rates in control arms than those of the EBCTCG meta-analysis. Taken together, these results suggest that one solution would not fit all N1 patients and that patient selection for PMRT shall be stratified upon risks factors. Most prominent of such factors identified are: patient age; number and ratio of positive lymph nodes; histological features such as lymphovascular invasion; and hormone receptor expression. FUTURE: A prospective randomized controlled trial SUPREMO will release its final results in 2023 and shed light onto the subject. Genomic tumor cell profiling will likely provide further guidelines in terms of risk stratification. SUPREMO translational sub-study will also offer material for genomic analyses. A cross-field tendency to forgo nodal dissection in favor of sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by nodal irradiation might eventually render the question of PMRT indication after ALND irrelevant.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
