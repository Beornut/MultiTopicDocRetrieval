This meta-analysis is designed to examine the clinical analgesic efficacy of Pecs block in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery.\nMETHODS:\nAn electronic literature search of the Library of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases was conducted to collect randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from inception to November 2018. These RCTs compared the effect of Pecs block in combination with general anesthesia (GA) to GA alone in mastectomy surgery. Pain scores, intraoperative and postoperative opioid consumption, time to first request for analgesia, and incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting were analyzed.\nRESULTS:\nThirteen RCTs with 940 patients were included in our analysis. The use of Pecs block significantly reduced pain scores in the postanesthesia care unit (weighted mean difference [WMD] = -1.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.90 to -0.91; P < .001) and at 24 hours after surgery (WMD = -1.01; 95% CI, -1.64 to -0.38; P < .001). Moreover, Pecs block decreased postoperative opioid consumption in the postanesthesia care unit (WMD = -1.93; 95% CI, -3.51 to -0.34; P = .017) and at 24 hours (WMD = -11.88; 95% CI, -15.50 to -8.26; P < .001). Pecs block also reduced intraoperative opioid consumption (WMD = -85.52; 95% CI, -121.47 to -49.56; P < .001) and prolonged the time to first analgesic request (WMD = 296.69; 95% CI, 139.91-453.48; P < .001).

Breast prosthesis can improve patient's figure externally, increase self-confidence, thus improving quality of life (QOL). Prospective study of different breast prostheses has not yet been performed in China. Our objective was to evaluate the QOL of patients wearing different types of breast prostheses and to compare the physical and psychological effects of different temperature-controlled breast prostheses on patients.\nMETHODS:\nThirty patients with breast cancer were recruited through the Yankang E-follow-up Platform at the Department of Breast Surgery of Fudan University, Shanghai Cancer Center and were randomized into either intervention or control group. Random number tables were used in this study for randomization. In the first 6 weeks of the study, self-adhesive breast prostheses and conventional breast prostheses had been used in the intervention and control group, respectively. In the later 6 weeks, the breast prostheses used were switched into another kind. Several dimensional parameters including skin conditions, breast prosthesis knowledge, breast prosthesis knowledge, QOL, and body image were examined by different questionnaires in the end of both 6th and 12th week.\nRESULTS:\nThere were no significant difference in QOL and body image between the 2 groups during 6th and 12th week. At the 6th week of the study, patients of the intervention group preferred to the self-adhesive breast prosthesis, indicating that the self-adhesive breast prosthesis seemed more likely to feel like part of their body, while prosthesis cleaning remaining their biggest concern. At the end of 12th week, in comparison with the number at 6th week, more patients in both groups were willing to choose self-adhesive breast prosthesis.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nWe conclude that women are satisfied with the temperature-controlled breast prosthesis and are more willing to choose self-adhesive breast prostheses although cleaning remains a problem. In China, patients still lack information about breast prostheses. Therefore, specialist breast nurses should provide comprehensive information about breast prostheses, assist patients in selecting suitable breast prostheses, collect feedback about the prostheses, and reduce each patient's physical and mental discomfort."}, {"authors": ["Qiu H", "Xu WH", "Kong J", "Ding XJ", "Chen DF"], "topic": "Mastectomy", "title": "Effect of breast-conserving surgery and modified radical mastectomy on operation index, symptom checklist-90 score and prognosis in patients with early breast cancer.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000019279", "publication": "Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Mar;99(11):e19279. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000019279.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nThe present study aims to analyze the effects of breast-conserving surgery and modified radical mastectomy on operation indexes, Symptom checklist-90 scores and prognosis in patients with early breast cancer.The clinical data of 128 patients with breast cancer who were treated in our hospital from May 2015 to May 2016 were included into the analysis.

Quantification of lymphatic contractility has previously been shown using a custom-built near-infrared imaging system. However, to broaden the clinical use of functional lymphatic measurements, these measurements need to be performed using a standard-of-care, clinically available camera. The authors propose an objective, algorithmic, and clinically accessible approach to quantify lymphatic contractility using a 3-minute indocyanine green lymphangiograph recorded with a commercially available near-infrared camera. A retrospective review of the authors' indocyanine green lymphangiography video repository maintained in a Research Electronic Data Capture database was performed. All patients with a newly diagnosed unilateral breast cancer undergoing preoperative indocyanine green lymphangiography were included in the analysis. Patient medical records were then analyzed for patient demographics, and videos were analyzed for contractility. Seventeen consecutive patients with unilateral breast cancers underwent video processing to quantify lymphatic contractility of the ipsilateral extremity in contractions per minute. All patients were women, with an average age of 60.5 years (range, 38 to 84 years). The average lymphatic contractility rate was 1.13 contractions per minute (range, 0.67 to 2.5 contractions per minute). Using a clinically accessible standard-of-care device for indocyanine green lymphangiography, the authors were able to determine lymphatic contractility rates of a normal extremity. The authors' finding falls within the range of previously published data quantifying lymphatic contractility using a research device, suggesting that the authors' technique provides a clinically accessible, time-effective means of assessing lymphatic contractility.

Costs were retrieved from supplier price lists, physician fee schedules, lymphedema therapists, and literature reviews. The net present value of all costs incurred for each clinical pathway were calculated.\nRESULTS:\nThe estimated net present value of all costs for a patient with breast cancer-related lymphedema undergoing treatment were as follows: (1) complete decongestive therapy alone ($30,400); (2) lymphovenous bypass no longer requiring ongoing complete decongestive therapy ($15,000); or (3) lymphovenous bypass requiring ongoing complete decongestive therapy ($42,100). The expected net present value of all costs for lymphovenous bypass was $26,800, which was comparable to that of complete decongestive therapy alone. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the expected net present value of lymphovenous bypass was dependent on the patient's life expectancy, number of bypass anastomoses, and likelihood of discontinuing complete decongestive therapy.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nLymphedema has substantial ongoing costs irrespective of the treatment modality. The cost of lymphovenous bypass appears comparable to that of complete decongestive therapy alone-the surgical costs of lymphovenous bypass are offset by the savings from discontinued ongoing therapy.

In patients undergoing mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction, there is concern that this treatment could increase postoperative complications. The authors characterize which patients are at a higher risk of experiencing a postoperative complication, and assess the impact of postoperative complications on timing of radiation treatment.\nMETHODS:\nA retrospective review was performed on patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction using tissue expanders. Multivariable binomial logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for experiencing a postoperative complication. Independent samples t tests were used to compare means for neoadjuvant chemotherapy timing and time to commencement of radiation therapy between patients with and without complications.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 128 patients were identified. Patients that experienced a complication had a statistically significant difference in time to commencement of radiation therapy (p = 0.021) and an elevated body mass index (p = 0.018) compared with patients who experienced no complication; there was no difference in timing interval of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.692). Logistic regression showed an associate between body mass index and postoperative complication (OR, 1.09; 95 percent CI, 1.018 to 1.167; p = 0.013).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nPostoperative complications delay the commencement of radiation therapy in patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and undergo mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction. The period from the last dose of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was equivalent between those that experienced postoperative complications and those that did not. Patients with a higher body mass index are more likely to experience postoperative complications, and this should be considered when offering tissue expanders to obese patients who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and require adjuvant radiation treatment.\nCLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:\nRisk, III."}, {"authors": ["Lee YS", "Lee HS", "Chang SW", "Lee CU", "Kim JS", "Jung YK", "Kim JH", "Seo YS", "Yim HJ", "Lee CH", "Woo SU", "Seo JH", "Yeon JE", "Um SH", "Byun KS"], "topic": "Mastectomy", "title": "Underlying nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a significant factor for breast cancer recurrence after curative surgery.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6775430/", "publication": "Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Sep;98(39):e17277. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000017277.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nBreast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, and it is a main cause of death in women.

Data variables were grouped into general, treatment-specific, cancer-specific, and follow-up variables and were matched. As proof-of-concept, mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction rates in patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ were analyzed.\nRESULTS:\nThe NBCA included 115 variables and SEER included 112. The NBCA included significantly more treatment-specific variables (n = 46 versus 6), whereas the SEER database included more cancer-specific variables (n = 74 versus 26). In patients diagnosed with breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ, immediate breast reconstruction was performed in 19.3 percent and 24.0 percent of the breast cancer cohort and 44.0 percent and 35.3 percent of the ductal carcinoma in situ cohort in the NBCA and SEER, respectively. Immediate breast reconstruction rates increased significantly over time in both data sets.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThis study provides a first overview of available registry data on breast cancer care in The Netherlands and the United States, and revealed limited data on treatment in the United States. Comparison of treatment patterns of immediate breast reconstruction showed interesting differences.

Initial doubts over the efficacy and safety of PMRT in these patients were partially overcome by improvement in technology and systemic treatments. Several randomized controlled clinical trials confirmed benefit of PMRT in N1 patients, which were meta-analyzed by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG). This meta-analysis provides the sole high-level evidence to guide clinical decision-making. PRESENT: Nevertheless, concerns have been evoked around these results, most notably concerning the patient selection bias and the era in which the patients were treated. More recent studies, albeit retrospective, are in contrast with this level I evidence, unequivocally reporting inferior recurrence rates in control arms than those of the EBCTCG meta-analysis. Taken together, these results suggest that one solution would not fit all N1 patients and that patient selection for PMRT shall be stratified upon risks factors. Most prominent of such factors identified are: patient age; number and ratio of positive lymph nodes; histological features such as lymphovascular invasion; and hormone receptor expression. FUTURE: A prospective randomized controlled trial SUPREMO will release its final results in 2023 and shed light onto the subject. Genomic tumor cell profiling will likely provide further guidelines in terms of risk stratification. SUPREMO translational sub-study will also offer material for genomic analyses. A cross-field tendency to forgo nodal dissection in favor of sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by nodal irradiation might eventually render the question of PMRT indication after ALND irrelevant.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To address unmet needs for contraception information and services, a community-based, gender-sensitive and culturally adapted brief counselling intervention (SIRIAN program) was launched in some deprived neighbourhoods with a high proportion of immigrants in Barcelona. Once a randomized controlled trial demonstrated its effectiveness in increasing the use of contraceptives, we aim to examine its population impact on adolescent fertility rates.\nMETHODS:\nQuasi-experimental study with comparison group, using population data from 2005 to 2016. Five neighbourhoods in the lowest tercile of Disposable Household Income were intervened in 2011-13. The comparison group included the three neighbourhoods which were in the same municipal district and in the lowest Disposable Household Income tercile, and displayed the highest adolescent fertility rates. Generalized linear models were fitted to assess absolute adolescent fertility rates and adjusted by immigrant population between pre-intervention (2005-10) and post-intervention periods (2011-16); Difference in Differences and relative pre-post changes analysis were performed.\nRESULTS:\nIn 2005-10 the intervention group adolescent fertility rate was 27.90 (per 1000 women 15-19) and 21.84 in the comparison group. In 2011-16 intervention areas experienced great declines (adolescent fertility rate change: - 12.30 (- 12.45 to - 12.21); p < 0.001), while comparison neighbourhoods remained unchanged (adolescent fertility rate change: 1.91 (- 2.25 to 6.07); p = 0.368). A reduction of - 10.97 points (- 13.91 to - 8.03); p < 0.001) is associated to the intervention.\nCONCLUSION:\nAdolescent fertility rate significantly declined in the intervention group but remained stable in the comparison group. This quasi-experimental study provide evidence that, in a country with universal health coverage, a community counselling intervention that increases access to contraception, knowledge and sexual health care in hard-to-reach segments of the population can contribute to substantially reduce adolescent fertility rates.

The WC and mass media campaign were introduced simultaneously in 40 urban wards in April 2016; half of the wards were randomly assigned to the treatment (IPC intervention) with cross-sectional surveys conducted before (n = 2,364) and one year after (n = 2,430) the start of the intervention. A pre-specified intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis measured the impact of randomization to IPC at the community level. In adjusted ITT models, there were no statistically significant differences between intervention and control groups. Due to significant implementation challenges, we also conducted exploratory secondary analyses to estimate effects among those who attended an IPC event (n = 66) using instrumental variable and inverse probability weighting analyses. In addition to increases in FC identification (IPC attendees had higher reported use of any condom, improved perceptions of FC's, and were more likely to have discussed contraceptive use with their partner as compared to non-attendees). The introduction of a new FC product combined with an IPC intervention significantly increased general knowledge and awareness in the community as compared to media alone, but did not lead to detectable community level impacts on other primary outcomes of interest. Observational evidence from our study suggests that IPC attendance is associated with increased use and negotiation. Future studies should explore the intensity and duration of IPC programming necessary to achieve detectable community level impacts on behavior.

Use of emergency contraception (EC) within 120 hours after unprotected or underprotected intercourse can reduce the risk of pregnancy. Emergency contraceptive methods include oral medications labeled and dedicated for use as EC by the US Food and Drug Administration (ulipristal and levonorgestrel), the \"off-label\" use of combined oral contraceptives, and insertion of a copper intrauterine device. Indications for the use of EC include intercourse without use of contraception; condom breakage or slippage; missed or late doses of contraceptives, including the oral contraceptive pill, contraceptive patch, contraceptive ring, and injectable contraception; vomiting after use of oral contraceptives; and sexual assault. Our aim in this updated policy statement is to (1) educate pediatricians and other physicians on available emergency contraceptive methods; (2) provide current data on the safety, efficacy, and use of EC in teenagers; and (3) encourage routine counseling and advance EC prescription as 1 public health strategy to reduce teenaged pregnancy.\nCopyright © 2019 by the American Academy of Pediatrics."}, {"authors": ["di Spiezio Sardo A", "Mastantuoni E", "De Angelis MC", "Zizolfi B"], "topic": "Birth Control", "title": "Contraception with the new intrauterine systems: a winning choice if shared!", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.23736/S0026-4784.19.04463-0", "publication": "Minerva Ginecol. 2019 Oct;71(5):377-384. doi: 10.23736/S0026-4784.19.04463-0.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nToday the rate of unexpected pregnancy is still unacceptably high; long-acting reversible contraceptives, (LARC) seem to be an effective and modern solution.

Although postpartum family planning (PPFP) is an increasingly high priority for many countries, uptake and need for PPFP varies in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to characterize postpartum contraceptive use, and predictors and barriers to use, among postpartum women in LMIC.\nMETHODS:\nPubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and Global Health databases were searched for articles and abstracts published between January 1997 and May 2018. Studies with data on contraceptive uptake through 12 months postpartum in low- and middle-income countries were included. We used random-effects models to compute pooled estimates and confidence intervals of modern contraceptive prevalence rates (mCPR), fertility intentions (birth spacing and birth limiting), and unmet need for contraception in the postpartum period.\nRESULTS:\nAmong 669 studies identified, 90 were selected for full-text review, and 35 met inclusion criteria. The majority of studies were from East Africa, West Africa, and South Asia/South East Asia. The overall pooled mCPR during the postpartum period across all regions was 41.2% (95% CI: 15.7-69.1%), with lower pooled mCPR in West Africa (36.3%; 95% CI: 27.0-45.5%). The pooled prevalence of unmet need was 48.5% (95% CI: 19.1-78.0%) across all regions, and highest in South Asia/South East Asia (59.4, 95% CI: 53.4-65.4%). Perceptions of low pregnancy risk due to breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhea were commonly associated with lack of contraceptive use and use of male condoms, withdrawal, and abstinence. Women who were not using contraception were also less likely to utilize maternal and child health (MCH) services and reside in urban settings, and be more likely to have a fear of method side effects and receive inadequate FP counseling. In contrast, women who received FP counseling in antenatal and/or postnatal care were more likely to use PPFP.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nPPFP use is low and unmet need for contraception following pregnancy in LMIC is high. Tailored counseling approaches may help overcome misconceptions and meet heterogeneous needs for PPFP."}, {"authors": ["Joy KM"], "topic": "Birth Control", "title": "Contraception options for patients with known hereditary risk for ovarian cancer.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1097/01.JAA.0000586384.47435.31", "publication": "JAAPA. 2019 Nov;32(11):37-41. doi: 10.1097/01.JAA.0000586384.47435.31.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nFor patients with a known hereditary risk of ovarian cancer, primary prevention typically is accomplished through prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
