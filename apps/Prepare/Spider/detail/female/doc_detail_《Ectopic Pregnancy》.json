This meta-analysis is designed to examine the clinical analgesic efficacy of Pecs block in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery.\nMETHODS:\nAn electronic literature search of the Library of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases was conducted to collect randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from inception to November 2018. These RCTs compared the effect of Pecs block in combination with general anesthesia (GA) to GA alone in mastectomy surgery. Pain scores, intraoperative and postoperative opioid consumption, time to first request for analgesia, and incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting were analyzed.\nRESULTS:\nThirteen RCTs with 940 patients were included in our analysis. The use of Pecs block significantly reduced pain scores in the postanesthesia care unit (weighted mean difference [WMD] = -1.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.90 to -0.91; P < .001) and at 24 hours after surgery (WMD = -1.01; 95% CI, -1.64 to -0.38; P < .001). Moreover, Pecs block decreased postoperative opioid consumption in the postanesthesia care unit (WMD = -1.93; 95% CI, -3.51 to -0.34; P = .017) and at 24 hours (WMD = -11.88; 95% CI, -15.50 to -8.26; P < .001). Pecs block also reduced intraoperative opioid consumption (WMD = -85.52; 95% CI, -121.47 to -49.56; P < .001) and prolonged the time to first analgesic request (WMD = 296.69; 95% CI, 139.91-453.48; P < .001).

Breast prosthesis can improve patient's figure externally, increase self-confidence, thus improving quality of life (QOL). Prospective study of different breast prostheses has not yet been performed in China. Our objective was to evaluate the QOL of patients wearing different types of breast prostheses and to compare the physical and psychological effects of different temperature-controlled breast prostheses on patients.\nMETHODS:\nThirty patients with breast cancer were recruited through the Yankang E-follow-up Platform at the Department of Breast Surgery of Fudan University, Shanghai Cancer Center and were randomized into either intervention or control group. Random number tables were used in this study for randomization. In the first 6 weeks of the study, self-adhesive breast prostheses and conventional breast prostheses had been used in the intervention and control group, respectively. In the later 6 weeks, the breast prostheses used were switched into another kind. Several dimensional parameters including skin conditions, breast prosthesis knowledge, breast prosthesis knowledge, QOL, and body image were examined by different questionnaires in the end of both 6th and 12th week.\nRESULTS:\nThere were no significant difference in QOL and body image between the 2 groups during 6th and 12th week. At the 6th week of the study, patients of the intervention group preferred to the self-adhesive breast prosthesis, indicating that the self-adhesive breast prosthesis seemed more likely to feel like part of their body, while prosthesis cleaning remaining their biggest concern. At the end of 12th week, in comparison with the number at 6th week, more patients in both groups were willing to choose self-adhesive breast prosthesis.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nWe conclude that women are satisfied with the temperature-controlled breast prosthesis and are more willing to choose self-adhesive breast prostheses although cleaning remains a problem. In China, patients still lack information about breast prostheses. Therefore, specialist breast nurses should provide comprehensive information about breast prostheses, assist patients in selecting suitable breast prostheses, collect feedback about the prostheses, and reduce each patient's physical and mental discomfort."}, {"authors": ["Qiu H", "Xu WH", "Kong J", "Ding XJ", "Chen DF"], "topic": "Mastectomy", "title": "Effect of breast-conserving surgery and modified radical mastectomy on operation index, symptom checklist-90 score and prognosis in patients with early breast cancer.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000019279", "publication": "Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Mar;99(11):e19279. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000019279.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nThe present study aims to analyze the effects of breast-conserving surgery and modified radical mastectomy on operation indexes, Symptom checklist-90 scores and prognosis in patients with early breast cancer.The clinical data of 128 patients with breast cancer who were treated in our hospital from May 2015 to May 2016 were included into the analysis.

Quantification of lymphatic contractility has previously been shown using a custom-built near-infrared imaging system. However, to broaden the clinical use of functional lymphatic measurements, these measurements need to be performed using a standard-of-care, clinically available camera. The authors propose an objective, algorithmic, and clinically accessible approach to quantify lymphatic contractility using a 3-minute indocyanine green lymphangiograph recorded with a commercially available near-infrared camera. A retrospective review of the authors' indocyanine green lymphangiography video repository maintained in a Research Electronic Data Capture database was performed. All patients with a newly diagnosed unilateral breast cancer undergoing preoperative indocyanine green lymphangiography were included in the analysis. Patient medical records were then analyzed for patient demographics, and videos were analyzed for contractility. Seventeen consecutive patients with unilateral breast cancers underwent video processing to quantify lymphatic contractility of the ipsilateral extremity in contractions per minute. All patients were women, with an average age of 60.5 years (range, 38 to 84 years). The average lymphatic contractility rate was 1.13 contractions per minute (range, 0.67 to 2.5 contractions per minute). Using a clinically accessible standard-of-care device for indocyanine green lymphangiography, the authors were able to determine lymphatic contractility rates of a normal extremity. The authors' finding falls within the range of previously published data quantifying lymphatic contractility using a research device, suggesting that the authors' technique provides a clinically accessible, time-effective means of assessing lymphatic contractility.

Costs were retrieved from supplier price lists, physician fee schedules, lymphedema therapists, and literature reviews. The net present value of all costs incurred for each clinical pathway were calculated.\nRESULTS:\nThe estimated net present value of all costs for a patient with breast cancer-related lymphedema undergoing treatment were as follows: (1) complete decongestive therapy alone ($30,400); (2) lymphovenous bypass no longer requiring ongoing complete decongestive therapy ($15,000); or (3) lymphovenous bypass requiring ongoing complete decongestive therapy ($42,100). The expected net present value of all costs for lymphovenous bypass was $26,800, which was comparable to that of complete decongestive therapy alone. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the expected net present value of lymphovenous bypass was dependent on the patient's life expectancy, number of bypass anastomoses, and likelihood of discontinuing complete decongestive therapy.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nLymphedema has substantial ongoing costs irrespective of the treatment modality. The cost of lymphovenous bypass appears comparable to that of complete decongestive therapy alone-the surgical costs of lymphovenous bypass are offset by the savings from discontinued ongoing therapy.

In patients undergoing mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction, there is concern that this treatment could increase postoperative complications. The authors characterize which patients are at a higher risk of experiencing a postoperative complication, and assess the impact of postoperative complications on timing of radiation treatment.\nMETHODS:\nA retrospective review was performed on patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction using tissue expanders. Multivariable binomial logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for experiencing a postoperative complication. Independent samples t tests were used to compare means for neoadjuvant chemotherapy timing and time to commencement of radiation therapy between patients with and without complications.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 128 patients were identified. Patients that experienced a complication had a statistically significant difference in time to commencement of radiation therapy (p = 0.021) and an elevated body mass index (p = 0.018) compared with patients who experienced no complication; there was no difference in timing interval of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.692). Logistic regression showed an associate between body mass index and postoperative complication (OR, 1.09; 95 percent CI, 1.018 to 1.167; p = 0.013).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nPostoperative complications delay the commencement of radiation therapy in patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and undergo mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction. The period from the last dose of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was equivalent between those that experienced postoperative complications and those that did not. Patients with a higher body mass index are more likely to experience postoperative complications, and this should be considered when offering tissue expanders to obese patients who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and require adjuvant radiation treatment.\nCLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:\nRisk, III."}, {"authors": ["Lee YS", "Lee HS", "Chang SW", "Lee CU", "Kim JS", "Jung YK", "Kim JH", "Seo YS", "Yim HJ", "Lee CH", "Woo SU", "Seo JH", "Yeon JE", "Um SH", "Byun KS"], "topic": "Mastectomy", "title": "Underlying nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a significant factor for breast cancer recurrence after curative surgery.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6775430/", "publication": "Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Sep;98(39):e17277. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000017277.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nBreast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, and it is a main cause of death in women.

Data variables were grouped into general, treatment-specific, cancer-specific, and follow-up variables and were matched. As proof-of-concept, mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction rates in patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ were analyzed.\nRESULTS:\nThe NBCA included 115 variables and SEER included 112. The NBCA included significantly more treatment-specific variables (n = 46 versus 6), whereas the SEER database included more cancer-specific variables (n = 74 versus 26). In patients diagnosed with breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ, immediate breast reconstruction was performed in 19.3 percent and 24.0 percent of the breast cancer cohort and 44.0 percent and 35.3 percent of the ductal carcinoma in situ cohort in the NBCA and SEER, respectively. Immediate breast reconstruction rates increased significantly over time in both data sets.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThis study provides a first overview of available registry data on breast cancer care in The Netherlands and the United States, and revealed limited data on treatment in the United States. Comparison of treatment patterns of immediate breast reconstruction showed interesting differences.

Initial doubts over the efficacy and safety of PMRT in these patients were partially overcome by improvement in technology and systemic treatments. Several randomized controlled clinical trials confirmed benefit of PMRT in N1 patients, which were meta-analyzed by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG). This meta-analysis provides the sole high-level evidence to guide clinical decision-making. PRESENT: Nevertheless, concerns have been evoked around these results, most notably concerning the patient selection bias and the era in which the patients were treated. More recent studies, albeit retrospective, are in contrast with this level I evidence, unequivocally reporting inferior recurrence rates in control arms than those of the EBCTCG meta-analysis. Taken together, these results suggest that one solution would not fit all N1 patients and that patient selection for PMRT shall be stratified upon risks factors. Most prominent of such factors identified are: patient age; number and ratio of positive lymph nodes; histological features such as lymphovascular invasion; and hormone receptor expression. FUTURE: A prospective randomized controlled trial SUPREMO will release its final results in 2023 and shed light onto the subject. Genomic tumor cell profiling will likely provide further guidelines in terms of risk stratification. SUPREMO translational sub-study will also offer material for genomic analyses. A cross-field tendency to forgo nodal dissection in favor of sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by nodal irradiation might eventually render the question of PMRT indication after ALND irrelevant.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To address unmet needs for contraception information and services, a community-based, gender-sensitive and culturally adapted brief counselling intervention (SIRIAN program) was launched in some deprived neighbourhoods with a high proportion of immigrants in Barcelona. Once a randomized controlled trial demonstrated its effectiveness in increasing the use of contraceptives, we aim to examine its population impact on adolescent fertility rates.\nMETHODS:\nQuasi-experimental study with comparison group, using population data from 2005 to 2016. Five neighbourhoods in the lowest tercile of Disposable Household Income were intervened in 2011-13. The comparison group included the three neighbourhoods which were in the same municipal district and in the lowest Disposable Household Income tercile, and displayed the highest adolescent fertility rates. Generalized linear models were fitted to assess absolute adolescent fertility rates and adjusted by immigrant population between pre-intervention (2005-10) and post-intervention periods (2011-16); Difference in Differences and relative pre-post changes analysis were performed.\nRESULTS:\nIn 2005-10 the intervention group adolescent fertility rate was 27.90 (per 1000 women 15-19) and 21.84 in the comparison group. In 2011-16 intervention areas experienced great declines (adolescent fertility rate change: - 12.30 (- 12.45 to - 12.21); p < 0.001), while comparison neighbourhoods remained unchanged (adolescent fertility rate change: 1.91 (- 2.25 to 6.07); p = 0.368). A reduction of - 10.97 points (- 13.91 to - 8.03); p < 0.001) is associated to the intervention.\nCONCLUSION:\nAdolescent fertility rate significantly declined in the intervention group but remained stable in the comparison group. This quasi-experimental study provide evidence that, in a country with universal health coverage, a community counselling intervention that increases access to contraception, knowledge and sexual health care in hard-to-reach segments of the population can contribute to substantially reduce adolescent fertility rates.

The WC and mass media campaign were introduced simultaneously in 40 urban wards in April 2016; half of the wards were randomly assigned to the treatment (IPC intervention) with cross-sectional surveys conducted before (n = 2,364) and one year after (n = 2,430) the start of the intervention. A pre-specified intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis measured the impact of randomization to IPC at the community level. In adjusted ITT models, there were no statistically significant differences between intervention and control groups. Due to significant implementation challenges, we also conducted exploratory secondary analyses to estimate effects among those who attended an IPC event (n = 66) using instrumental variable and inverse probability weighting analyses. In addition to increases in FC identification (IPC attendees had higher reported use of any condom, improved perceptions of FC's, and were more likely to have discussed contraceptive use with their partner as compared to non-attendees). The introduction of a new FC product combined with an IPC intervention significantly increased general knowledge and awareness in the community as compared to media alone, but did not lead to detectable community level impacts on other primary outcomes of interest.

Although postpartum family planning (PPFP) is an increasingly high priority for many countries, uptake and need for PPFP varies in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to characterize postpartum contraceptive use, and predictors and barriers to use, among postpartum women in LMIC.\nMETHODS:\nPubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and Global Health databases were searched for articles and abstracts published between January 1997 and May 2018. Studies with data on contraceptive uptake through 12 months postpartum in low- and middle-income countries were included. We used random-effects models to compute pooled estimates and confidence intervals of modern contraceptive prevalence rates (mCPR), fertility intentions (birth spacing and birth limiting), and unmet need for contraception in the postpartum period.\nRESULTS:\nAmong 669 studies identified, 90 were selected for full-text review, and 35 met inclusion criteria. The majority of studies were from East Africa, West Africa, and South Asia/South East Asia. The overall pooled mCPR during the postpartum period across all regions was 41.2% (95% CI: 15.7-69.1%), with lower pooled mCPR in West Africa (36.3%; 95% CI: 27.0-45.5%). The pooled prevalence of unmet need was 48.5% (95% CI: 19.1-78.0%) across all regions, and highest in South Asia/South East Asia (59.4, 95% CI: 53.4-65.4%). Perceptions of low pregnancy risk due to breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhea were commonly associated with lack of contraceptive use and use of male condoms, withdrawal, and abstinence. Women who were not using contraception were also less likely to utilize maternal and child health (MCH) services and reside in urban settings, and be more likely to have a fear of method side effects and receive inadequate FP counseling. In contrast, women who received FP counseling in antenatal and/or postnatal care were more likely to use PPFP.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nPPFP use is low and unmet need for contraception following pregnancy in LMIC is high.

In cervical cancer, p53 is inactivated by degradation through the complex with human papilloma virus (HPV) oncoprotein E6 and E6-associated protein (E6AP), an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase. In endometrial cancer, overexpression of p53 in immunohistochemistry is a significant prognostic factor. A discrepancy between p53 overexpression and TP53 mutations is observed in endometrioid endometrial cancer, indicating that the accumulation of p53 protein can be explained by not only gene mutations but also dysregulation of the factors such as ERβ and MDM2. Furthermore, the double-positive expression of immunoreactive estrogen receptor (ER) β and p53 proteins is closely associated with the incidence of metastasis and/or recurrence. High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) arises from secretary cells in the fallopian tube. The secretary cell outgrowth (SCOUT) with TP53 mutations progresses to HGSC via the p53 signature, serous intraepithelial lesion (STIL), and serous intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC), indicating that TP53 mutation is associated with carcinogenesis of HGSC.

Preliminary clinical data reported Bevacizumab effectiveness in EC both as single agent and in combination with chemotherapy.\nMETHODS:\nIn a phase II trial, patients with advanced (FIGO stage III-IV) or recurrent EC were randomized to receive Carboplatin-Paclitaxel standard dose for 6-8 cycles vs Carboplatin-Paclitaxel and Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg in combination with chemotherapy and maintenance until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).\nRESULTS:\n108 patients were randomized; PFS (10.5 vs 13.7 months, HR 0.84 p = 0.43), overall response rate (ORR 53.1% vs 74.4%) and overall survival (OS) (29.7 vs 40.0 months, HR 0.71 p = 0.24) resulted in a non-significant increase in Bevacizumab treated patients. The PFS increase became significant when an exploratory analysis with the Breslow test was used. Moreover, patients treated with Bevacizumab experienced a significant increase in 6-month disease control rate (70.4% vs 90.7%).

One to two prior cytotoxic regimens were allowed; prior use of a MEK or PI3K pathway inhibitor was excluded. Initial trial design consisted of a KRAS mutation stratified randomized phase II with a safety lead-in evaluating the combination. For the safety lead in, the previously recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D; trametinib 1.5 mg, GSK2141795 50 mg) was chosen for Dose Level 1 (DL1).\nRESULTS:\nOf 26 enrolled patients, 14 were treated on DL1 and 12 were treated on DL-1 (trametinib 1.5 mg, GSK2141795 25 mg). Most common histologies were endometrioid (58%) and serous (27%). Four of 25 (16%) patients were KRAS mutant. Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were assessed during cycle 1. DL1 had 8 DLTs (hypertension (n = 2), mucositis (2), rash (2), dehydration, stroke/acute kidney injury). DL1 was deemed non-tolerable so DL-1 was explored. DL-1 had no DLTs. Sixty-five percent of patients had ≥ grade 3 toxicity. There were no responses in DL1 (0%, 90%CI 0-15%) and 1 response in DL-1 (8.3%, 90%CI 0.4-33.9%).

We investigated the oncologic safety and complication rates of early-stage EC treated with laparotomy (LAP) versus minimally invasive hysterectomy (MIH). A secondary study aim was the evaluation of risk factors for relapse and complications.\nMETHODS:\nData from the Cancer Registry Rostock, Germany, and the medical records of women diagnosed with type 1 EC between January 2005 and December 2014 were retrospectively evaluated. The baseline characteristics were analyzed with the χ2 test and Fisher's exact test. Multivariate analysis with the Cox proportional-hazards model and logistic regression were performed to identify prognostic factors for time to event and risk factors for complications. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed for disease-free and overall survival.\nRESULTS:\nOf 350 evaluated patients, 242 underwent traditional LAP; on 108 patients, MIH was performed. The median follow-up period in the LAP group and the MIH group was 82 ± 31.1 and 71.1 ± 33.6 months, respectively (p = 0.10). The median time to event was 40.3 ± 28.1 months in the LAP group and 38.0 ± 27.5 months in the MIH group (p = 0.476). Significantly longer surgery times (p < 0.001) and more complications (p < 0.001) were observed in the LAP group. Disease-free survival after MIH was not significantly different from that after LAP (log-rank p = 0.052). Multimorbidity remained as the single risk factor for event/recurrence (p = 0.019) in multivariate analysis.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nMIH for early-stage EC may be an oncologically safe approach when compared to LAP, and its complication rates are lower; therefore, MIH represents the preferred approach for this patient cohort.\n© 2019 S.

Based on this assessment, we selected a balanced sample of cows that remained healthy (no signs of illness; n = 20), cows diagnosed with either HYK (n = 20) or metritis (n = 20), and cows with both HYK and metritis (n = 20). Video recordings from the 8 wk before calving (scored every 2 wk for 90 min immediately after fresh feed delivery) were used to evaluate feeding behavior and competition at the feed bunk. Feeding behavior before calving was associated with postpartum diagnosis of HYK and metritis. Specifically, cows that spent less time eating had higher odds of HYK and metritis. Odds of remaining healthy (compared with becoming sick with at least 1 condition) increased by 1.3 times for every additional 15 min spent eating. Additionally, cows that were involved in fewer agonistic interactions prepartum were more likely to be diagnosed with both conditions during the postpartum period. Odds of remaining healthy (compared with becoming sick with at least one condition) increased by 1.9 times for every 6 additional interactions. We conclude that prepartum feeding and agonistic behaviors can be used to identify animals at risk of HYK and metritis postpartum.\nCopyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

Although numerous studies have been performed to find the therapeutic agents for endometritis, the incidence of this disease remains high.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effects and mechanisms of sodium butyrate (SB) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endometritis in mice. The mice were administered by intraperitoneal injection of SB at 1 h before LPS injection. 24 h later, the uterus tissues were collected. Hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) stained sections of uterus were used to determine the degree of the damage. Uterine myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was used to analyze neutrophil granulocytes concentration. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were measured by ELISA. The activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. The results showed that SB significantly attenuated the pathological injury of the uterus tissues. SB also suppressed LPS-induced MPO activity and the production of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β. Furthermore, Western blot analysis showed that SB inhibited the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway. In addition, SB could inhibit histone deacetylases. In summary, SB protects against LPS-induced endometritis through HDAC inhibition.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we treated hESCs with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and found that LPS treatment increased the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, and TNFα, and the secretion of IL-6. SR9009, a Rev-erbα agonist, significantly alleviated the LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in hESCs. Meanwhile, knockdown of Rev-erbα increased the expressions of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8, accompanied by an increased mRNA level of the core clock gene Bmal1. Western blot analysis showed that SR9009 inhibited the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the activation of NF-κB induced by LPS. All these findings suggested that pharmacological activation of Rev-erbα attenuated the LPS-induced inflammatory response of hESCs by suppressing TLR4-regulated NF-κB activation. This study may provide a strategy for preventing inflammation-related endometrial dysfunction and infertility or recurrent implantation failure.\n© The Author(s) 2019.

The incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) has increased due to the sexually active status of the young population. This leads to a more serious problem and a larger effect than previously observed. However, there have been few studies on this topic in Asian populations.\nAIM:\nWe aimed to evaluate the risk of preterm labor and/or ectopic pregnancy in Taiwanese women following PID.\nDESIGN:\nUsing the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database, we designed a retrospective cohort study that included 12- to 55-year-old pregnant women between 2000 and 2010. We selected a 1:3 age-matched control group of non-PID women. The endpoint was any episode of preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy; otherwise, the patients were tracked until 31 December 2010.\nMETHODS:\nThe risk factors for preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy were explored. For cases included from the index date until the end of 2010, we analyzed the risk of incident preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy. With the use of a multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, we calculated the hazard ratio (HR) with a 95% CI and compared it with that of the control group.\nRESULTS:\nThis study examined 30,450 patients with PID and 91,350 controls. During the follow-up period, patients in the PID group were more likely to develop preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy than patients in the control group. The cumulative incidence rates for developing preterm labor were 1.84% (561/30,450 individuals) in patients with PID and 1.63% (1492/91,350 individuals) in patients without PID. On the other hand, the cumulative incidence rate for developing ectopic pregnancy in patients with PID was 0.05% (14/30,450 individuals) but was only 0.04% (33/91,350 individuals) in patients without PID. Compared with those without PID, the patients with PID had a 1.864 times (P<0.001) higher risk of developing preterm labor and a 2.121 times (P = 0.003) higher risk of developing ectopic pregnancy.\nCONCLUSION:\nOur study provided evidence of an increased risk of preterm labor or ectopic pregnancy in PID patients."}, {"authors": ["Voon HY", "Pow JY", "Tan LN", "Suharjono HN", "Teo WS"], "topic": "Pelvic Inflammatory Disease", "title": "Antibiotic prophylaxis in ragged placental membranes: a prospective, multicentre, randomized trial.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6624936/", "publication": "BMC Pregnancy Childbirth. 2019 Jul 11;19(1):240. doi: 10.1186/s12884-019-2373-9.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nRagged placental membranes is a distinct entity from retained placenta and not uncommonly reported in midwifery texts. Although the incidence of postpartum endometritis is merely 1-5% after vaginal births, it remains the most common source of puerperal sepsis, contributing up to 15% of maternal mortality in low income countries. Geographically-remote centres in Malaysia prophylactically administer antibiotics for women with ragged placental membranes after vaginal birth, extrapolating evidence from retained placenta. We sought to clarify the rationale in continuing such practices.\nMETHODS:\nThis was an open-label, prospective, multicentre, randomized trial. Three hospitals where the current protocol was to administer prophylactic amoxycillin-clavulanic acid served as the sites of recruitment. Women who delivered vaginally beyond 24+ 0 weeks of gestation with ragged membranes were invited to participate in the trial and randomized into prophylaxis or expectant management with medical advice by blocks of 10, at a 1:1 ratio. A medication adherence diary was provided and patients followed up at 2 weeks and 6 weeks postpartum.\nRESULTS:\nA total of 6569 women gave birth vaginally in three centres during the trial period, of which 10.9% had ragged membranes. The incidence of endometritis was not significantly raised in women with or without prophylaxis (0.90% vs 0.29%; p = 0.60). All cases of endometritis presented within the first 2 weeks and preventive use of antibiotics did not ameliorate the severity of endometritis since rates of ICU admission, surgical evacuation and transfusion were comparable.\nCONCLUSION:\nPreventive use of antibiotics after vaginal delivery in women with ragged placental membranes did not result in a reduction of endometritis. Educating women on the signs and symptoms of endometritis would suffice. Based on the reported incidence of ragged membranes, a change in practice would result in 1500 less prescriptions of antibiotics per annum in these three centres.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION:\nNCT03459599 (Retrospectively registered on 9 March 2018)."}, {"authors": ["Fouks Y", "Azem F", "Many A", "Cohen Y", "Levin I", "Cohen A"], "topic": "Pelvic Inflammatory Disease", "title": "Fertility outcomes in patients with tubo-ovarian abscesses after an oocyte retrieval: a longitudinal cohort analysis.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-019-05230-9", "publication": "Arch Gynecol Obstet. 2019 Sep;300(3):763-769. doi: 10.1007/s00404-019-05230-9.

A retrospective cohort study of 136 patients admitted to a tertiary hospital in Singapore for TOA between July 2013 and December 2017 was performed.

Twenty rats were divided into two groups: control group (n = 10) and treatment group (n = 10). hUCMSCs were given to mice after exposure to C. trachomatis for 4 weeks. After treatment for 4 weeks, five mice were randomly selected from each of the two groups to sacrifice and we examined the organ morphology and pathology, inflammatory cytokines, proliferation, and apoptosis in fallopian tube (FT).The remaining five mice from each group were caged 2:1 with male mice for another 4 weeks, the numbers of pregnant mice and the mean number of pups in the different groups were enumerated and calculated.\nRESULTS:\nIntravaginal inoculation of hUCMSCs alleviated hydrosalpinx of the oviduct. EdU-labeled hUCMSCs are located at the interstitial site of the fallopian tube. Macrophage (F4/80) infiltration was significantly reduced in the treatment group compared with the control group and expression levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 were increased after hUCMSCs treatment. Furthermore, mRNA and protein expression levels of PCNA and Caspase-3 were increased and decreased, respectively, in the hUCMSCs' treatment group compared with the control.

The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of endometritis (as defined by the presence of any abnormal vaginal discharge after 21 days post-partum) on post-partum ovarian cyclicity in dairy cows. Milk progesterone analysis was used to monitor reproductive cyclicity in 170 dairy cows across three different commercial herds. Associations between the occurrence of endometritis and the incidence risk of a variety of atypical cycle profiles during the calving to conception period were investigated to establish the importance of endometritis on post-partum ovarian activity. Endometritis increased the incidence odds of atypical ovarian profiles (P < 0.05) with prolonged luteal activity being the most affected (P < 0.05), but also showed prolonged time (3 days) to onset of luteal activity after parturition (P < 0.05). Using milk progesterone analysis, we found a relatively low incidence odds for reproductive cycle problems in healthy cows during the calving to conception period. However, the incidence odds of cycle problems, in particular prolonged luteal activity, were high in cows that had experienced endometritis, which would have significantly impaired reproductive function.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The remaining two works were a retrospective observational trial and a retrospective case series respectively. Five studies evaluated the effects of tibolone, also comparing it with various estrogen/progestin combinations, while two were about raloxifene. Thirteen studies compared different combinations of estrogens/progestins, the most common being transdermal estrogens (used in nine studies) and medroxyprogesterone acetate at different doses (used in 10 studies). Conclusions: For women with uterine fibroids, the choice of the most appropriate HRT regimen is crucial to avoid leiomyomas growth and the symptoms possibly related to it. Available data are conflicting, but suggest that uterine fibroids might be influenced by HRT, without representing an absolute contraindication to hormonal replacement therapy. Women with uterine fibroids subjected to HRT should be periodically examined and hormonal treatment should be discontinued if leiomyomas appear to increase in size. Moreover, the minimal effective dose of progestin should be employed."}, {"authors": ["Palma F", "Fontanesi F", "Facchinetti F", "Cagnacci A"], "topic": "Hormone Replacement Therapy", "title": "Acupuncture or phy(F)itoestrogens vs. (E)strogen plus progestin on menopausal symptoms.

Between 2008 and 2014, participants reported any episodes of diverticulitis that required antibiotics and the date of occurrence. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nRESULTS:\nOver 24 years encompassing 1,297,165 person-years of follow-up, we documented 5,425 incident cases of diverticulitis. We observed an increased risk of diverticulitis among both current (HR 1.28; 95% CI 1.18-1.39) and past (HR 1.35; 95% CI 1.25-1.45) MHT users compared to never users.

The risk did not increase with longer duration of use (P-trend = 0.76). The association between MHT and diverticulitis was not modified by age, body mass index, past oral contraceptive use, or fiber intake (all P-interaction >0.11).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nMenopausal hormone therapy was associated with an increased risk of diverticulitis.

An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health and menopause was recruited by NAMS to review the 2012 Position Statement, evaluate new literature, assess the evidence, and reach consensus on recommendations, using the level of evidence to identify the strength of recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees.Hormone therapy (HT) remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture. The risks of HT differ depending on type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is used. Treatment should be individualized to identify the most appropriate HT type, dose, formulation, route of administration, and duration of use, using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation of the benefits and risks of continuing or discontinuing HT.For women aged younger than 60 years or who are within 10 years of menopause onset and have no contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio is most favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and for those at elevated risk for bone loss or fracture. For women who initiate HT more than 10 or 20 years from menopause onset or are aged 60 years or older, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of the greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and dementia. Longer durations of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistent VMS or bone loss, with shared decision making and periodic reevaluation. For bothersome GSM symptoms not relieved with over-the-counter therapies and without indications for use of systemic HT, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy or other therapies are recommended.This NAMS position statement has been endorsed by Academy of Women's Health, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American Association of Nurse Practitioners, American Medical Women's Association, American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Asociación Mexicana para el Estudio del Climaterio, Association of Reproductive Health Professionals, Australasian Menopause Society, Chinese Menopause Society, Colegio Mexicano de Especialistas en Ginecologia y Obstetricia, Czech Menopause and Andropause Society, Dominican Menopause Society, European Menopause and Andropause Society, German Menopause Society, Groupe d'études de la ménopause et du vieillissement Hormonal, HealthyWomen, Indian Menopause Society, International Menopause Society, International Osteoporosis Foundation, International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health, Israeli Menopause Society, Japan Society of Menopause and Women's Health, Korean Society of Menopause, Menopause Research Society of Singapore, National Association of Nurse Practitioners in Women's Health, SOBRAC and FEBRASGO, SIGMA Canadian Menopause Society, Società Italiana della Menopausa, Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, South African Menopause Society, Taiwanese Menopause Society, and the Thai Menopause Society.

The issue is of utmost public health importance because coronary heart disease (CHD) remains the leading cause of death among postmenopausal women. Fortunately, a unifying hypothesis has emerged that reproductive stage is a major determinant of the effect of estrogens on atherosclerosis progression, complications, and plaque vulnerability.\nPREMENOPAUSAL YEARS:\nPremenopausal atherosclerosis progression seems to be an important determinant of postmenopausal atherosclerosis and thus the risk for CHD. Clearly, plasma lipids/lipoproteins influence this progression; however, estradiol deficiency seems to be the major modulator. Both monkeys and women with premenopausal estrogen deficiency develop premature atherosclerosis, an effect that can be prevented in both species by estrogen-containing oral contraceptives.\nPERIMENOPAUSAL/EARLY POSTMENOPAUSAL YEARS:\nDuring this stage, there are robust estrogen benefits. Monkeys given estrogens immediately after surgical menopause have a 70% inhibition in coronary atherosclerosis progression. Estrogen treatment prevented progression of atherosclerosis of women in the Estrogen in the Prevention of Atherosclerosis Trial. A meta-analysis of women younger than 60 years given hormone therapy had reduced total mortality (relative risk = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.39-0.95).\nLATE POSTMENOPAUSAL YEARS:\nThis stage is one in which there are no or possible deleterious estrogen effects. Monkeys lose CHD benefits of estrogens when treatment is delayed. The increase in CHD events associated with initiating hormone therapy 10 or more years after menopause seems to be related to up-regulation of the plaque inflammatory processes and plaque instability and may be down-regulated by statin pretreatment."}, {"authors": ["Ettinger B", "Li DK", "Klein R"], "topic": "Hormone Replacement Therapy", "title": "Continuation of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy: comparison of cyclic versus continuous combined schedules.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1097/GME.0000000000001215", "publication": "Menopause. 2018 Nov;25(11):1187-1190. doi: 10.1097/GME.0000000000001215.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nDiscontinuation of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is much more common than what is reported in randomized, double-blind clinical trials.

We hypothesized CEE alone induces estrogen hydroxylation along the 2-pathway rather than the competing 16-pathway, a pattern linked to reduced postmenopausal breast cancer risk. One thousand eight hundred and sixty-four women in a WHIOS case-control study of estrogen metabolism and ovarian and endometrial cancer were studied of whom 609 were current E + P users (351 used CEE + MPA), while 272 used E alone (162 used CEE). Fifteen EM were measured, and analyses were conducted for each metabolite, hydroxylation pathway (2-, 4-, or 16-pathway) and ratios of pathway concentrations using inverse probability weighted linear regression. Compared to E + P users, all EM were higher in E alone users (significant for unconjugated estrone, total/conjugated estradiol, total/unconjugated 2-methoxyestrone, 4-methoxyestrone and unconjugated estriol). The relative concentrations of 2- and 4-pathway EM did not differ between the MHT users (2-pathway EM comprised 15% and 4-pathway EM <2% of the total), but 16-pathway EM were lower in E alone users (p = 0.036). Ratios of 2- and 4-pathway EM compared to 16-pathway EM were significantly higher in E alone compared to E + P users. Similar but not significant patterns were observed in CEE-alone and CEE + MPA users. Our data suggest that compared to E + P users, women using E alone have more extensive metabolism via the 2- vs. the competing 16-pathway.

We compared the former use of estradiol-progestogen postmenopausal hormone therapy in nonhysterectomized women with a uterine prolapse surgery (N = 12,072) and control women (N = 33,704).\nMETHODS:\nThe women with a history of uterine prolapse operation were identified from the Finnish National Hospital Discharge Register, and the control women from the Finnish Central Population Register. The use of hormone therapy was traced from the national drug reimbursement register, and the odd ratios with 95% CIs for prolapse were calculated by using the conditional logistic regression analysis.\nRESULTS:\nThe women with uterine prolapse had used hormone therapy more often than control women (N = 4,127; 34.2% vs N = 9,189; 27.3%; P < 0.005). The use of hormone therapy was accompanied by significant (23%-53%) elevations in the risk for prolapse, being higher with longer exposure.

In some animal models, progesterone affects cognitive performance, and its potential role in human cognition is especially germane to women.

In naturally cycling reproductive-age women and pregnant women, there is no consistent relation between progesterone levels and cognition. In postmenopausal women within 6 years of menopause and not using hormone therapy, progesterone levels are positively associated with verbal memory and global cognition, but reported associations in older postmenopausal women are null. Some observational studies of postmenopausal women using hormone therapy raise concern of a small deleterious cognitive effect of progestogen (medroxyprogesterone acetate was most often reported in these studies), but this association may due to confounding factors.

Costs and effects were analysed with this model for four different cost scenarios: high-, higher medium, lower medium and low-cost. Base case, sensitivity, threshold, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to examine the cost-effectiveness implications of PGT-A.\nRESULTS:\nPGT-A increased the cost per live birth by approximately 15% in the high-cost scenario to approximately 285% in the low-cost scenario. Threshold analysis revealed that PGT-A would need to be associated with an absolute increase in pregnancy rate by 6% to >39% or, alternatively, would need to be US$2,969 (high-cost scenario) to US$4,888 (low-cost scenario) cheaper.

Several risk factors have been associated with an increased risk of stillbirth: including maternal medical factors, maternal characteristics, fetal factors, sociodemographic factors and behavioral factors. The aim of this work is to review the literature on risk factors that have a behavioral component. The main behaviors modulating the risk of stillbirth that have been more widely studied in the literature include use of substances (smoking, alcohol, illicit drugs and medical drugs), weight management, attendance at antenatal care and sleeping position. There is evidence in the literature that supports that all those behaviors have an impact on the risk of stillbirth, especially in the cases of smoking and drugs consumption during the pregnancy.

Basic neonatal resuscitation can reduce intrapartum stillbirth and early neonatal mortality, if delivered in a high-quality health system, but there is a dearth of evidence on how to scale up such evidence-based interventions. We evaluated the scaling up of a quality improvement (QI) package for neonatal resuscitation on intrapartum-related mortality (intrapartum stillbirth and first day mortality) at hospitals in Nepal.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS:\nWe conducted a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial in 12 hospitals over a period of 18 months from April 14, 2017, to October 17, 2018. The hospitals were assigned to one of four wedges through random allocation. The QI package was implemented in a stepped-wedge manner with a delay of three months for each step. The QI package included improving hospital leadership on intrapartum care, building health workers' competency on neonatal resuscitation, and continuous facilitated QI processes in clinical units. An independent data collection system was set up at each hospital to gather data on mortality through patient case note review and demographic characteristics of women using semi-structured exit interviews. The generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) and multivariate logistic regression were used for analyses. During this study period, a total of 89,014 women-infant pairs were enrolled. The mean age of the mother in the study period was 24.0 ± 4.3 years, with 54.9% from disadvantaged ethnic groups and 4.0% of them illiterate. Of the total birth cohort, 54.4% were boys, 16.7% had gestational age less than 37 weeks, and 17.1% had birth weight less than 2,500 grams. The incidence of intrapartum-related mortality was 11.0 per 1,000 births during the control period and 8.0 per 1,000 births during the intervention period (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69-0.92; p = 0.002; intra-cluster correlation coefficient [ICC], 0.0286). The incidence of early neonatal mortality was 12.7 per 1,000 live births during the control period and 10.1 per 1,000 live births during the intervention period (aOR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.78-1.02; p = 0.09; ICC, 0.1538). The use of bag-and-mask ventilation for babies with low Apgar score (<7 at 1 minute) increased from 3.2% in the control period to 4.0% in the intervention period (aOR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.32-1.77, p = 0.003). There were two major limitations to the study; although a large sample of women-infant pairs were enrolled in the study, the clustering reduced the power of the study. Secondly, the study was not sufficiently powered to detect reduction in early neonatal mortality with the number of clusters provided.\nCONCLUSION:\nThese results suggest scaled-up implementation of a QI package for neonatal resuscitation can reduce intrapartum-related mortality and improve clinical care. The QI intervention package is likely to be effective in similar settings.

From the psychological perspective pregnancy loss and perinatal death are amongst the most stressful events in human life - carrying increased risk of developing affective, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorders. Psychologists, physicians and the rest of the medical staff should provide integrated and individualized care which should be based on respect, empathy and expertise. The necessary phases of support for women experiencing pregnancy loss are: (1) physician providing exhaustive informational support regarding state of health, potential causes of fetal death, further approach and phases of induced labor of the fetus/pregnancy termination/procedure, (2) facilitating psychological consultation at any time and (3) providing exhaustive information on current legal standing (health insurance and labor law).

Epub 2019 Jul 9.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nRIF is clinically defined as the failure of good quality embryos to implant into the uterus following at least three cycles of In Vitro Fertilization/Embryo Transfer (IVF/ET). During human pregnancy, a genetically different fetus is allowed to survive within the uterus despite the maternal recognition of fetal alloantigens. Compared with normal pregnant women, early loss of embryo is associated with systemic lower levels of Treg cells in IVF. Moreover, several lines of evidence have indicated that differentiation of naive T cells into Th17 is deleterious for normal pregnancy and may cause implantation failure. Sirolimus as the most common mTOR (mammalian target of Rapamycin) inhibitor is able to effectively prevent allograft rejection. Here we aimed to evaluate Sirolimus effects on Th17/Treg axis and subsequently on pregnancy outcome.\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS:\n121 patients with a history of at least 3 implatation failures were selected and enrolled in this clinical trial. Blood was drawn between days 5 and 10 of the cycle prior to the index IVF/ET cycle to assess baseline value of Th17 cells and regulatory T cells ratios using flowcytometry. A Th17/Treg cell ratio equal or >0.74 was considered to be the elevated Th17/Treg cell ratio. In 76 patients with elevated Th17/Treg ratios, 43 individuals were treated with Sirolimus and 33 remained untreated.\nRESULTS:\nOur results demonstrated that Sirolimus treatment led to an increase in Treg cells number and function in treated group and reduced the frequency and function of Th17 cells. Moreover Th17/Treg cell ratio, significantly reduced from 1.18 ± 0.46% to 0.9 ± 0.45% following Sirolimus intervention (P = 0.024). In contrast, no significant difference in Th17 and Treg cell frequencies and Th17/Treg cell ratio was observed in untreated control subjects before and after ET. Finally our data showed a significantly higher clinical pregnancy rate (55.81%) in Sirolimus-treated patients compared with control group (24.24%) (P < 0.0005). We also found a significantly increased live birth rate (48.83%) in RIF women who received Sirolimus compared with control group (21.21%) (P < 0.0001).\nCONCLUSION:\nThe findings of the current study revealed the fact that Sirolimus exhibit potent immunosuppressive effects by blocking intracellular immune responses downstream of co-stimulatory signals, also is able to improve reproductive outcome in RIF women with imbalanced Th17/Treg ratio by modulate of Th17 /Treg axis, thus representing a new approach for the potential treatment of patients with embryo implantation failure.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Assessed outcomes included qPCR viral load profile during treatment, number of antiviral intravitreal injections (IVT), retinal detachment rate, and best-corrected visual acuity.\nRESULTS:\nFinal visual acuity was 20/200 or less in 20% of cases; the rate of retinal detachment was 16%. Viral load kinetics changed in 3 phases: a first plateau period that was not consistent, a logarithmic decrease phase, and a negativation phase. Mean decay of the logarithm of the viral load was estimated at 0.076 per day; mean time of negativation was 56.1 days. Median IVT number was 9 (range, 0-28). Ten patients were treated with injections until the viral load was undetectable. Resistance to acyclovir was observed in a patient with a prolonged initial plateau of the viral load.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nNumerous and prolonged IVTs, used as adjunctive therapy, could improve the prognosis of treated patients by decreasing the risk of retinal detachment and improving visual acuity. QPCR enables monitoring of the response to treatment and can provide evidence for resistance to antiviral treatment by enabling the detection of cases with a prolonged initial plateau of viral load.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, incidence is low and acyclovir, the treatment of choice, carries risk of toxicity. We aimed to increase the percentage of patients 0 to 60 days of age who are tested and treated for HSV in accordance with local guideline recommendations from 40% to 80%.\nMETHODS:\nThis quality improvement project took place at 1 freestanding children's hospital. Multiple plan-do-study-act cycles were focused on interventions aimed at key drivers including provider buy-in, guideline availability, and accurate identification of high-risk patients. A run chart was used to track the effect of interventions on the percentage managed per guideline recommendations over time by using established rules for determining special cause. Pre- and postimplementation acyclovir use was compared by using a χ2 test. In HSV-positive cases, delayed acyclovir initiation, defined as >1 day from presentation, was tracked as a balancing measure.\nRESULTS:\nThe median percentage of patients managed according to guideline recommendations increased from 40% to 80% within 8 months. Acyclovir use decreased from 26% to 7.9% (P < .001) in non-high-risk patients but did not change significantly in high-risk patients (73%-83%; P = .15).

Based on the wrist-ankle acupuncture (WAA) theory, we designed a portable WAA point compression treatment strap that treats diseases by automatically applying pressure to acupuncture points. The proposed study aims to evaluate the immediate analgesic effect of the acupressure wrist-ankle strap in patients with primary dysmenorrhea.\nMETHODS:\nThe study will be a randomized controlled trial conducted from May 1, 2019 to May 30, 2020 that includes 78 students from Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine who have primary dysmenorrhea and meet the eligibility criteria. Participants will be randomly divided into 2 groups in a 1:1 allocation ratio. The intervention group will use the acupressure wrist-ankle strap equipped with tip compression component parts on the internal side; the control group will use the nonacupressure wrist-ankle strap with the tip compression parts removed. All participants will be treated for 30 minutes on the 1st day of menstruation. The primary outcome is the pain intensity score measured by the visual analog scale. The secondary outcomes are the onset time of analgesia, the pain threshold at Yinlingquan (SP 9), skin temperature at Guanyuan (CV 4), and expectations and satisfaction of patients as investigated via the expectation and treatment credibility scale.\nDISCUSSION:\nThis trial will be the 1st study to evaluate the analgesic effect of the acupressure wrist-ankle strap in patients with primary dysmenorrhea.

This randomized controlled parallel trial is designed to evaluate the immediate analgesic effect and hemodynamic responses in uterine arterial blood flow of perpendicular needling and transverse needling at SP6 in patients with PD of cold-dampness stagnation pattern using color doppler ultrasonography.\nMETHODS:\nForty-eight patients who meet inclusion criteria will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to either perpendicular needling or transverse needling groups. Every participant will receive 1 session of acupuncture treatment for 10 minutes at bilateral SP6. In the perpendicular needling group, needles will be inserted vertically 1 to 1.2 cun and will be manipulated to achieve needling sensation. In transverse needling group, the needles will be inserted transversely 1 to 1.2 cun toward the abdomen without any manipulation to avoid needling sensation. Color doppler ultrasonography will be performed before, during, and after needling. The primary outcome measure is visual analog scale for pain. The secondary outcome measures include the uterine artery blood flow changes by measuring pulsatility index, resistance index values, and ratio of systolic peak and diastolic peak, the Hamilton anxiety scale, blood pressure, and heart rate.

The evaluation of the methodological quality of the studies was carried out by PEDro scale.\nDATA SYNTHESIS:\nThere was moderate evidence that therapeutic exercise can be considered a useful tool in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea in terms of a reduction in pain intensity. Regarding the duration of pain and quality of life, there was low evidence and very low evidence, respectively. In the 3 meta-analyses, the results were significantly positive in favor of exercise for decreases in both the intensity and the duration of pain.\nLIMITATIONS:\nLimitations of this study include the great heterogeneity of the interventions applied in the studies in terms of type of exercise, in combination or alone, and dosage. This review includes a small number of studies with risk of bias, so the present findings must be interpreted with caution.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nTherapeutic exercise reduces pain intensity in patients with primary dysmenorrhea.\n© 2019 American Physical Therapy Association."}, {"authors": ["Xu L", "Xie T", "Shen T", "Zhang T"], "topic": "Period Pain", "title": "Effect of Chinese herbal medicine on primary dysmenorrhea: A protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6756727/", "publication": "Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Sep;98(38):e17191. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000017191.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nPrimary dysmenorrhea (PD), the most common gynecological diseases, seriously affects women's life and work; however, without more effective treatment.

Women often seek online information on dysmenorrhoea; however, little is known about the information quality.\nDESIGN:\nThis was a descriptive study to evaluate online information on dysmenorrhoea.\nMETHODS:\nWe imitated search strategies of the general public. Specifically, we employed the three most popular search engines worldwide-Google, Yahoo and Bing-and used lay search terms, \"period pain\" and \"menstrual cramps.\" We screened 60 web pages. Following removal of duplicates and irrelevant web pages, 25 met the eligibility criteria. Two team members independently evaluated the included web pages using standardised tools. Readability was evaluated with the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease and Flesch-Kincaid Grade formulas; credibility, quality and usability were evaluated with established tools. We followed the STROBE checklist for reporting this study.\nRESULTS:\nFor readability, the mean Flesch-Kincaid level was 10th grade. For credibility, 8% of web pages referenced scientific literature and 28% stated the author's name and qualifications. For quality, no web page employed user-driven content production; 8% of web pages referenced evidence-based guidelines, 32% of web pages had accurate content, and 4% of web pages recommended shared decision-making.

From studies in patients with endometriosis and premenstrual disorder, it has been shown that these symptoms can have a large impact on women's quality of life and account for substantial health care use. Furthermore, it is estimated that many women initially do not consult a doctor while facing menstrual symptoms. Consequently, the impact of menstrual symptoms on daily activities in the general population is unknown.\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo obtain a nationwide overview of menstrual symptoms and their impact on everyday activities.\nSTUDY DESIGN:\nNationwide, cross-sectional, internet-based survey among 42,879 women aged 15-45 years, conducted from July to October 2017.\nOUTCOME MEASURES:\npresence of menstrual symptoms, pain or intensity score, impact on daily activities.\nRESULTS:\nDysmenorrhea was the most common symptom, with a prevalence of 85%, followed by psychological complaints (77%), and tiredness (71%). During their menstrual period, 38% of all women reported not to be able to perform all their regular daily activities. From the women that had to skip tasks because of their symptoms, only 48.6% told their family that menstrual symptoms were the reason for the transfer of tasks.\nCONCLUSION:\nMenstrual symptoms are widespread among the general population. One in 3 women quit daily activities owing to menstrual symptoms. Half of all women did not mention menstrual complaints being the reason for transferring tasks in a family setting. These results must be interpreted with caution owing to the potential for selection bias. However, considering the impact of menstrual symptoms on daily activities in a large group of women, it is time to open the societal dialogue and improve education for both patients and doctors.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

VAS score after the 3rd month of treatment in the XZD plus WM group was also lower than that in the WM group (mean difference -0.45, 95% confidence interval [-0.79, -0.12], P < .01). In 4 XZD versus WM design studies, XZD sole therapy showed better response rate than did WM sole therapy (relative risk 1.26, 95% confidence interval [1.06, 1.49], P < .01).\nCONCLUSION:\nThe existing trials showed a favorable effect of XZD for the management of primary dysmenorrhea. However, the efficacy of XZD on primary dysmenorrhea is not conclusive owing to the small number of studies and the high risk of bias. Large-scale, long-term RCTs with rigorous methodological input are needed to clarify the role of XZD for the management of primary dysmenorrhea.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:\nCRD42016050447 in PROSPERO 2016."}, {"authors": ["Dias SFL", "Pereira LCA", "Oliveira AP", "Santos RFD", "Nunes LCC"], "topic": "Period Pain", "title": "Scientific and technological prospection on transdermal formulations and complementary therapies for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/13543776.2019.1562547", "publication": "Expert Opin Ther Pat. 2019 Feb;29(2):115-126. doi: 10.1080/13543776.2019.1562547.

Epub 2018 May 5.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\nDysmenorrhea is a pervasive pain condition that affects 20-50% of reproductive-aged women. Distension of a visceral organ, such as the uterus, could elicit a visceromotor reflex, resulting in involuntary skeletal muscle activity and referred pain. Although referred abdominal pain mechanisms can contribute to visceral pain, the role of abdominal muscle activity has not yet been investigated within the context of menstrual pain.\nOBJECTIVE:\nThe goal of this study was to determine whether involuntary abdominal muscle activity precedes spontaneous episodes of menstrual cramping pain in dysmenorrheic women and whether naproxen administration affects abdominal muscle activity.\nSTUDY DESIGN:\nAbdominal electromyography activity was recorded from women with severe dysmenorrhea (n = 38) and healthy controls (n = 10) during menses. Simultaneously, pain was measured in real time using a squeeze bulb or visual analog rheostat. Ninety minutes after naproxen administration, abdominal electromyography activity and menstrual pain were reassessed. As an additional control, women were also recorded off menses, and data were analyzed in relation to random bulb squeezes. Because it is unknown whether mechanisms of menstrual cramps are different in primary or secondary dysmenorrhea/chronic pelvic pain, the relationship between medical history and abdominal muscle activity was examined. To further examine differences in nociceptive mechanisms, pressure pain thresholds were also measured to evaluate changes in widespread pain sensitivity.\nRESULTS:\nAbdominal muscle activity related to random-bulb squeezing was rarely observed in healthy controls on menses (0.9 ± 0.6 episodes/hour) and in dysmenorrhea participants off menses (2.3 ± 0.6 episodes/hour). In dysmenorrheic participants during menses, abdominal muscle activity frequently preceded bulb squeezing indicative of menstrual cramping pain (10.8 ± 3.0 episodes/hour; P < .004). Whereas 45% of the women with dysmenorrhea (17 of 38) had episodes of abdominal muscle activity associated pain, only 13% (5 of 38) had episodes after naproxen (P = .011). Women with the abdominal muscle activity-associated pain were less likely to have a diagnosis for secondary dysmenorrhea or chronic pelvic pain (2 of 17) than women without this pain phenotype (10 of 21; P = .034). Similarly, women with the abdominal muscle activity-associated pain phenotype had less nonmenstrual pain days per month (0.6 ± 0.5) than women without the phenotype (12.4 ± 0.3; P = .002). Women with abdominal muscle activity-associated pain had pressure pain thresholds (22.4 ± 3.0 N) comparable with healthy controls (22.2 ± 3.0 N; P = .967). In contrast, women without abdominal muscle activity-associated pain had lower pressure pain thresholds (16.1 ± 1.9 N; P = .039).\nCONCLUSION:\nAbdominal muscle activity may contribute to cramping pain in primary dysmenorrhea but is resolvable with naproxen. Dysmenorrheic patients without cramp-associated abdominal muscle activity exhibit widespread pain sensitivity (lower pressure pain thresholds) and are more likely to also have a chronic pain diagnosis, suggesting their cramps are linked to changes in central pain processes. This preliminary study suggests new tools to phenotype menstrual pain and supports the hypothesis that multiple distinct mechanisms may contribute to dysmenorrhea.\nCopyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We used Mahalanobis and exact matched sampling within propensity score calipers to compare 381 youth suspended for the first time in a 1-year period with 980 non-suspended youth. The suspended and non-suspended youth were similar on 67 pre-suspension variables. We evaluated STI outcomes 5 years after suspension.\nRESULTS:\nBefore matching, suspended youth were more likely to test positive for trichomoniasis and gonorrhea, but not chlamydia, than non-suspended youth. Suspended youth were more likely to test positive for trichomoniasis 5 years after suspension than matched non-suspended youth (OR = 2.87 (1.40, 5.99)). Below-median household income before suspension explained 9% of the suspension-trichomoniasis association (p = 0.02), but criminal justice involvement and educational attainment were not statistically significantly mediators.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nSchool suspension is a marker for STI risk. Punishing adolescents for initial deviance may cause them to associate with riskier sexual networks even if they graduate high school and avoid criminal justice system involvement.

Data about sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle-related behaviors, routine hygienic practices, menstrual care and history and type of contraceptive intake were collected using a structured questionnaire. Vaginal discharge samples were collected and examined for discharge characteristics and pH by a gynecologist. Then, samples were examined for BV, VVC and TV.

This pathogen secretes extracellular vesicles (EVs) that mediate its interaction with host cells.

We show that T. vaginalis EVs interact with glycosaminoglycans on the surface of host cells and specifically bind to heparan sulfate (HS) present on host cell surface proteoglycans. Moreover, competition assays using HS or removal of HS from the host cell surface strongly inhibit EV uptake, directly demonstrating that HS proteoglycans facilitate EV internalization. We identified an abundant protein on the surface of T. vaginalis EVs, 4-α-glucanotransferase (Tv4AGT), and show using isothermal titration calorimetry that this protein binds HS. Tv4AGT also competitively inhibits EV uptake, defining it as an EV ligand critical for EV internalization. Finally, we demonstrate that T. vaginalis EV uptake is dependent on host cell cholesterol and caveolin-1 and that internalization proceeds via clathrin-independent, lipid raft-mediated endocytosis.

However, many women leave without a clear diagnosis or experience recurrent symptoms despite treatment. The 3 most common etiologies of vaginitis are trichomonas, bacterial vaginosis, and vulvovaginal candidiasis, which account for an estimated 70% of cases. The remaining 30% may be related to other causes of vaginitis, including atrophic vaginitis, desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, and vaginal erosive disease. The purpose of this review is to describe the noncandidal causes of acute and recurrent vaginitis, with the goal of improving the likelihood of accurate diagnosis as well as efficient and effective therapy. We excluded candidal vaginitis from our review because there was a recently published review on this topic in the Journal. The clinical presentation and evaluation of patients with symptoms of vaginitis can be triaged into 1 of 2 diagnostic pathways: noninflammatory and inflammatory vaginitis. The most common noninflammatory cause is bacterial vaginosis. Features such as irritation, purulent discharge, and the presence of polymorphonuclear neutrophils are more suggestive of an inflammatory process. Trichomoniasis is the most common cause of inflammatory vaginitis. Other well-described forms of inflammatory vaginitis include atrophic vaginitis, desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, and erosive disease. We present a review of the pathogenesis, symptoms, examination findings, diagnostic testing, and treatment for each of these causes of noncandidal vaginitis.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

They were also screened, and treated if applicable, for other urogenital infections. The vaginal microbiota was assessed by Gram stain Nugent scoring, Illumina 16S rRNA HiSeq sequencing (relative abundances), and BactQuant 16S gene quantitative polymerase chain reaction (estimated concentrations). Only women with a pretreatment Nugent score of 7-10 and a valid posttreatment Nugent score (N=55) were included in metronidazole treatment failure analyses, with treatment failure defined as a posttreatment Nugent score of 4-10.\nRESULTS:\nThe bacterial vaginosis cure rate by Nugent scoring was 54.5%. The mean total vaginal bacterial concentration declined from 6.59 to 5.85 log10/μL (P<.001), which was mostly due to a reduction in mean bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobes concentration (all bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobe taxa combined) from 6.23 to 4.55 log10/μL (P<.001). However, only 16.4% of women had a bacterial vaginosis anaerobes concentration reduction of more than 50%, and only 3 women had complete eradication. The mean concentration of lactobacilli (all species combined) increased from 4.98 to 5.56 log10/μL (P=.017), with L. iners being the most common species pre- and posttreatment. The mean concentration of pathobionts (defined as Proteobacteria, streptococci, staphylococci, enterococci, and a few others) did not change significantly: from 1.92 log10/μL pretreatment to 2.01 log10/μL posttreatment (P=.939). Pretreatment pathobionts concentration, and having a pretreatment vaginal microbiota type containing more than 50% Gardnerella vaginalis (compared with less than 50%), were associated with increased likelihood of treatment failure, but the latter did not reach statistical significance (P=.044 and P=.084, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nMetronidazole alone may not cure women with high G. vaginalis relative abundance, potentially due to biofilm presence, and women with high pathobionts concentration.

However, few studies have investigated the extent to which it involves the prostate in the current antimicrobial era. We addressed this question by investigating the relation between T. vaginalis antibody serostatus and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration, a marker of prostate infection, inflammation, and/or cell damage, in young, male, US military members.\nMETHODS:\nWe measured T. vaginalis serum IgG antibodies and serum total PSA concentration in a random sample of 732 young, male US active duty military members. Associations between T. vaginalis serostatus and PSA were investigated by linear regression.\nRESULTS:\nOf the 732 participants, 341 (46.6%) had a low T. vaginalis seropositive score and 198 (27.0%) had a high score, with the remainder seronegative. No significant differences were observed in the distribution of PSA by T. vaginalis serostatus. However, slightly greater, nonsignificant differences were observed when men with high T. vaginalis seropositive scores were compared with seronegative men, and when higher PSA concentrations were examined (≥0.70 ng/mL). Specifically, 42.5% of men with high seropositive scores had a PSA concentration greater than or equal to 0.70 ng/mL compared with 33.2% of seronegative men (adjusted P = .125).\nCONCLUSIONS:\nOverall, our findings do not provide strong support for prostate involvement during T. vaginalis infection, although our suggestive positive findings for higher PSA concentrations do not rule out this possibility entirely. These suggestive findings may be relevant for prostate condition development because higher early- to mid-life PSA concentrations have been found to predict greater prostate cancer risk later in life.\n© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, {"authors": ["Joseph Davey DL", "Nyemba DC", "Gomba Y", "Bekker LG", "Taleghani S", "DiTullio DJ", "Shabsovich D", "Gorbach PM", "Coates TJ", "Klausner JD", "Myer L"], "topic": "Trichomoniasis", "title": "Prevalence and correlates of sexually transmitted infections in pregnancy in HIV-infected and- uninfected women in Cape Town, South Africa.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6602171/", "publication": "PLoS One. 2019 Jul 1;14(7):e0218349. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0218349. eCollection 2019.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nOBJECTIVES:\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs) are associated with adverse outcomes in pregnancy, including mother-to-child HIV transmission.

Incidence and mortality of cervical cancer are unequally distributed among socioeconomic groups, warranting research into how individual socioeconomic factors contribute to this unbalanced uptake of prevention strategies.\nDESIGN:\nSystematic review and narrative synthesis.\nMETHODS:\nThe PRISMA guidelines (PLoS Medicine, 6, 2009, e1000097) guided the selection of papers. MEDLINE, CINHAL, PsychINFO, Science Citation Index and HMIC were searched. Ten articles were suitable. Key findings were then extracted, and a narrative synthesis was completed, using suitable guidance and the AXIS tool.\nRESULTS:\nObtaining high school or college education is associated with uptake of both cervical screening and HPV vaccination. Total household income and income in respect of the countries' poverty line was measured less frequently than education, but associated with screening and vaccination in some studies. Occupation was infrequently measured in comparison to education and income, limiting conclusions of its association to uptake.\nCONCLUSION:\nEducation and income have an association with uptake of cervical screening and HPV vaccination among women. However, evidence is insufficient to affirm a relationship between occupation and uptake of screening and vaccination. Further research would be advised to strengthen these findings.\nRELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE:\nInterventions to promote cervical cancer prevention strategies should be targeted at women and girls with lower education levels and lower income. However, differences are displayed in the relationships between the individual socioeconomic factors and uptake of preventative strategies between countries and populations and so they should be considered separately. Nurses play a considerable role in people's perceptions and experiences of cervical screening and HPV vaccination.

The challenges in introducing quality cytology screening in LMICs led to the evaluation of alternative screening approaches such as visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing-based screening. Large-scale clinical trials have generated sufficient evidence of efficacy of HPV-based screening for the introduction as the primary technology in cervical cancer screening. Being more objective, automated with better sensitivity than cytology requiring fewer rounds of screening and opportunity for self-sampling, HPV testing is thus poised to be more cost-effective in providing opportunity for wider coverage, making it ideal for incorporating into primary screening programs of LMIC settings that could help reduce regional disparities.

We analysed normal tissues, samples with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs). We correlated the presence of HHV-6 and HHV-7 with the finding of human papillomavirus (HPV) in mucosal samples.\nMETHODS:\nCervical samples were examined and grouped as follows: group 1 (n=29), normal cytology; group 2 (n=61), samples with LSIL; group 3 (n=35), samples with HSIL. Molecular biology examinations were performed in all samples to detect HHV-6, HHV-7 and HPV DNA and to typify HHV-6 species.\nRESULTS:\nGroup 1: normal cytology and HPV (-): HHV-6: 6.8% (2/29), HHV-7: 79.3% (23/29); group 2: LSIL and HPV (-): HHV-6: 93.1% (27/29), HHV-7: 96.5% (28/29); LSIL and HPV (+): HHV-6: 0% (0/32), HHV-7: 90.6% (29/32); group 3: HSIL and HPV (-): HHV-6: 20% (2/10), HHV-7: 70% (7/10); HSIL HPV (+): HHV-6: 12% (3/25), HHV-7: 68% (17/25). HHV-6A DNA was not detected in any samples.\nCONCLUSIONS:\n(1) Both HHV-6 and HHV-7 infect the mucosal cells of the cervix with higher prevalence of HHV-7. (2) The higher prevalence of HHV-6 in LSIL HPV (-) samples compared with those with normal cytology indicates that it constitutes a possible risk factor for atypia production. (3) The presence of HHV-7 in all samples questions its role in the production of atypia. (4) The finding of HHV-6 and HHV-7 suggests that the cervical mucosa is a possible transmission pathway for these viruses.\n© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. No commercial re-use.

CytoProcessor (DATEXIM, Caen, France) is a new automated system, designed to integrate seamlessly into the laboratory's existing workflow. We previously demonstrated the superior performance of CytoProcessor for diagnosis of ThinPrep slides compared to the ThinPrep Imaging System (HOLOGIC, Marlborough, MA). Next, we analyzed whether CytoProcessor technology can be adapted for use on Novaprep slides.\nMETHODS:\nUsing artificial intelligence, we developed a new algorithm in CytoProcessor for the analysis of slides prepared using the NOVAPREP Processor System NPS50 (Novacyt, Vélizy-Villacoublay, France). A representative population of 309 cases was selected from the routine workflow in a public hospital. We compared the diagnoses made using CytoProcessor or conventional screening with a microscope. All discordances were resolved by a consensus committee.\nRESULTS:\nThe performance of CytoProcessor in terms of diagnostic accuracy on Novaprep slides was very similar to that observed previously on ThinPrep slides. Compared to conventional screening, CytoProcessor slightly improves diagnostic sensitivity while maintaining a statistically equivalent specificity. Diagnosis was reached 1.6 times faster with CytoProcessor compared to using a microscope.\nCONCLUSION:\nCytoProcessor is a robust automated cervical cytology screening system that can be used successfully with samples having very different characteristics. As previously shown, CytoProcessor confers significant gains in processing time and diagnostic precision. CytoProcessor is accessible through a secured internet connection, making remote diagnosis of Papanicolaou tests possible.\n© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, {"authors": ["Kilic A", "Tastan S", "Guvenc G", "Akyuz A"], "topic": "Cervical Cancer Screening", "title": "Breast and cervical cancer screening for women with physical disabilities: A qualitative study of experiences and barriers.", "doi_url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.14048", "publication": "J Adv Nurs. 2019 Sep;75(9):1976-1986. doi: 10.1111/jan.14048.

However, his landmark research on the development of cervical cytology for the detection of precancerous lesions of the cervix (\"New Cancer Diagnosis,\" 1928) made a rather inauspicious debut in an unlikely venue: John Harvey Kellogg's Third Race Betterment Conference-a meeting devoted to the furtherance of the concept and implementation of eugenics. Herein, we discuss the stark juxtaposition of Papanicolaou's landmark discovery amid the pseudoscience of the third Race Betterment Conference. We discuss the latency of Papnicolaou's discovery-its potential implications unrealized-until co-publication with Herbert Traut, which catapulted Papanicolaou's research to the scientific foreground. This gave rise to public health initiatives aimed at establishing the Pap smear as a screening tool. We further delineate the progress made in recent decades with the identification of HPV as the etiological agent for cervical cancer, and the subsequent development of the HPV vaccine, and discuss ongoing research in the present day. In this way, we hope to provide a background and historical context for the development of the Pap smear.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Little is known of the genetic basis of diminished ovarian reserve, while premature ovarian insufficiency often has a genetic basis, with genes affecting various processes. NR5A1 is a key gene required for gonadal function, and variants are associated with a wide phenotypic spectrum of disorders of sexual development, and are found in 0.26-8% of patients with premature ovarian insufficiency. As there is some debate about the extent of involvement of NR5A1 in the pathogenesis of ovarian deficiency, we performed an in-depth analysis of NR5A1 variants detected in a cohort of 142 patients with premature ovarian insufficiency, diminished ovarian reserve, or unexplained infertility associated with normal ovarian function. We identified rare non-synonymous protein-altering variants in 2.8 % of women with ovarian deficiency and no such variants in our small cohort of women with infertility but normal ovarian function. We observed previously reported variants associated with premature ovarian insufficiency in patients with diminished ovarian reserve, highlighting a genetic relationship between these conditions. We confirmed functional impairment resulting from a p.Val15Met variant, detected for the first time in a patient with premature ovarian insufficiency. The remaining variants were associated with preserved transcriptional activity and localization of NR5A1, indicating that rare NR5A1 variants may be incorrectly curated if functional studies are not undertaken, and/or that NR5A1 variants may have only a subtle impact on protein function and/or confer risk of ovarian deficiency via oligogenic inheritance.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Females with Turner syndrome are characterized by skeletal abnormalities, short stature and primary ovarian insufficiency. The aim of this narrative review was to identify the underlying mechanisms of osteoporosis in Turner syndrome, summarize its clinical manifestations and provide suggestions regarding the management of osteoporosis. Girls and women with Turner syndrome have lower bone mineral density and a higher fracture rate than healthy individuals. The most important risk factors for osteoporosis are inadequately treated primary ovarian insufficiency, followed by intrinsic bone abnormalities. Comorbidities that further increase the risk of osteoporosis include vitamin D deficiency, celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, hearing problems can predispose to falls. Early initiation of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) at the age of 11-13 years, prompt titration to the adult dose after 2 years and long-term follow-up to ensure compliance with HRT are the cornerstones of osteoporosis prevention in women with Turner syndrome.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Uncertainty was examined using probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses, together with a scenario analysis incorporating a different perspective.\nRESULTS:\niCBT was slightly more expensive than the waiting list control, but also more effective, resulting in incremental cost-utility ratios of €23,331/QALY and €11,277/QALY for the guided and self-managed formats, respectively. A significant reduction in overall levels of menopausal symptoms or perceived impact of HF/NS resulted in incremental costs between €1460 and €1525 for the guided and €500-€753 for the self-managed format. The estimated annual budget impact for the Netherlands was €192,990 for the guided and €74,592 for the self-managed format.\nCONCLUSION:\nBased on the current trial data, the results indicate that both guided and self-managed iCBT are cost-effective with a willingness-to-pay threshold of well below €30,000/QALY.

Women with early menarche and nulliparity or low parity are also at a higher risk of experiencing premature or early menopause. Cigarette smoking (with a strong dose-response effect) and being underweight have been consistently associated with premature and early menopause. Current guidelines for the management of premature and early menopause mainly focus on early initiation of hormone therapy (HT) and continued treatment until the woman reaches the average age at menopause (50-52 years). We suggest that clinicians and health professionals consider the age at menopause of the relevant region or ethnic group as part of the assessment for the timing of HT cessation. In addition, there should be early monitoring of women with a family history of early menopause, who are a child of a multiple pregnancy, or who have had early menarche (especially those who have had no children). As part of preventive health strategies, women should be encouraged to quit smoking (preferably before the age of 30 years) and maintain optimal weight in order to reduce their risk of premature or early menopause.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Increasing data from experimental animal models and epidemiological studies indicate that exposure to a number of ubiquitously distributed reproductively toxic environmental chemicals (RTECs) can contribute to earlier menopause and even premature ovarian failure. However, the causative relationship between environmental chemical exposure and earlier menopause in women remains poorly understood. The present work, is an attempt to review the current evidence regarding the effects of RTECs on the main ovarian activities in mammals, focusing on how such compounds can affect the ovarian reserve at any stages of ovarian development. We found that in rodents, strong evidence exists that in utero, neonatal, prepubescent and even adult exposure to RTECs leads to impaired functioning of the ovary and a shortening of the reproductive lifespan. Regarding human, data from cross-sectional surveys suggest that human exposure to certain environmental chemicals can compromise a woman's reproductive health and in some cases, correlate with earlier menopause. In conclusion, evidences exist that exposure to RTECs can compromise a woman's reproductive health. However, human exposures may date back to the developmental stage, while the adverse effects are usually diagnosed decades later, thus making it difficult to determine the association between RTECs exposure and human reproductive health. Therefore, epidemiological surveys and more experimental investigation on humans, or alternatively primates, are needed to determine the direct and indirect effects caused by RTECs exposure on the ovary function, and to characterize their action mechanisms."}, {"authors": ["Pan Z", "Cui J", "Shan G", "Chou Y", "Pan L", "Sun Z", "Cui Z", "Sun J", "Cao Y", "Zhao J", "Ma X", "Ma J", "He H", "Ma J", "Zhong Y"], "topic": "Menopause", "title": "Prevalence and risk factors for pterygium: a cross-sectional study in Han and Manchu ethnic populations in Hebei, China.", "doi_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6398733/", "publication": "BMJ Open. 2019 Feb 21;9(2):e025725. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025725.", "references": null, "abstract": "Abstract\nAIMS:\nTo investigate the prevalence, ethnic differences and associated risk factors for pterygium in Han and Manchu populations aged 40-79 years in Hebei province, China.\nDESIGN:\nCross-sectional study, as a part of the China National Health Survey.\nSETTING:\nHebei province, China.\nPARTICIPANTS:\nA multistage cluster sampling method with urbanisation level-based stratification was used to select participants for this study.

Our aim was to determine the association between body mass index (BMI) and surgical menopausal symptoms.\nMETHODS:\nWe report a retrospective review of endometrial cancer patients whom underwent menopause secondary to their surgical staging procedure. Symptoms were classified as severe if treatment was prescribed, or mild if treatment was offered, but declined. Univariate analysis was performed with ANOVA and Chi-square tests as appropriate. Relative risks (RR) were generated from Poisson regression models.\nRESULTS:\nWe identified 166 patients in whom the BMI (kg/m2) distribution was as follows: 33 (19.9%) had BMI <30, 49 (29.5%) had BMI 30-39.9, 50 (30.1%) had BMI 40-49.9, and 34 (20.5%) had BMI ≥50. There were no differences in race, age, or adjuvant treatment among the groups. Overall, 65 (39.2%) women reported symptoms of surgical menopause, including 19 (11.4%) mild and 46 (27.7%) severe. Symptom type did not differ by BMI; however, the prevalence of severe menopausal symptoms decreased with increasing BMI: <30 (45.5%), 30-39.9 (30.6%), 40-49.9 (22%), and ≥ 50 (14.7%); P = 0.002. Multivariate analysis confirmed that symptom prevalence decreased with increasing BMI.

Hormone therapy (HT) is recommended for women with no contraindications. However, HT is greatly underutilized among these women due to their fear of the associated risks. The objective of this study is to identify and describe determinants of HT uptake and decision-making in women after surgical menopause. Methods We searched Medline, EMBASE, and CINAHL, from inception to April 2018, to identify relevant literature. Inclusion criteria included studies that assessed factors affecting the uptake of HT and decision-making about HT after surgical menopause. Studies including both women with natural and surgical menopause were included. Search terms were derived from 3 main concepts: surgical menopause, hormone therapy, and decision-making. Papers included in the review had to be in the English language and to report human studies. Results Of the 1952 articles identified, 23 were eligible for inclusion. Studies were mostly published before the WHI (61%) and had a quantitative cross-sectional study design. Only 22% focused on surgical menopause per se. The mean age at time of surgical menopause was 43.6 years (range 29-68). HT uptake was associated with younger age, higher level of education, higher income and adopting positive lifestyle behaviors. Factors affecting decision-making were mostly perceptions, beliefs, and values women associate with HT, as well as knowledge of and experiences with HT and surgical menopause. External factors related to physicians' recommendations and information sources also influenced HT decision-making. Conclusion Our review highlights the complex nature of decision-making about HT after surgical menopause and the numerous factors involved. Women tend to rely on subjective perceptions and inferences from information sources, which may hamper the ability to make informed treatment decisions. There is a need for tailored decision-aid interventions to help support women and guide informed treatment decisions.\nCopyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The etiopathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome has not been elucidated in detail. There are numerous hypotheses on this subject which tend to complement one another. The most widely recognized hypothesis is that the development of PCOS is due to insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, which subsequently lead to hyperandrogenism. On the basis of an as of yet relatively small number of studies, an increased prevalence of various psychiatric disorders can be observed in women with PCOS. These include: depression, generalized anxiety disorder, personality disorders, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and eating disorders. Bipolar affective disorder, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders have also been reported in women with PCOS more often than in the general population. The higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders in patients with PCOS, especially depression and anxiety disorders, may be due to both hyperandrogenism and the resulting somatic symptoms. These symptoms can undoubtedly be stigmatizing for women and lower their quality of life.

This study aims to report a literature review considering epidemiological and molecular mechanisms that correlate PCOS and breast cancer, as well as the influence of PCOS treatment on the incidence of breast cancer. Epidemiological studies failed to adjust potential variables that affect the risk and have thus provided inconclusive results. Molecular effects of androgenic pathways in breast cancer have been studied and androgens seem to have an inhibitory effect on mammary epithelial proliferation. However, increased bioavailable androgens were associated with recurrence of breast cancer due to conversion to oestrogens. Sex hormone-binding globulin has a role in hormone-dependent cancers and can be considered a marker for PCOS; a gene profile has already been linked to breast cancer risk in these patients. PCOS medical treatment is a promising tool for stratifying breast cancer risk due to the metabolic influence and hormonal environment. Clinical reports are inconsistent, emphasizing the need for further studies with a prospective design. In the future, the role of pharmacological interventions in PCOS will increase knowledge and awareness of breast cancer pathogenesis and will help to refine breast cancer risk stratification.\nCopyright © 2019.

Animal models of PCOS aids in studying various facts beginning from etiology to the treatment, hence, several animal models have been developed. Despite of the establishment of several models and a number of studies on PCOS, lacunae exist. This may be due to the failure in selecting a suitable animal model, as all animal models may not exhibit all the key features of the human PCOS condition or may exhibit traits similar to other diseased conditions in addition to the PCOS which should be excluded. Therefore, in this review, we have discussed the different animal models, features they exhibit, their merits and limitations which may aid in the selection of the relevant animal model of PCOS based upon the investigation's focus.

The mechanism of PCOS is not yet fully understood, but insulin resistance and genetic factors may play distinct roles in the pathomechanism. There is ongoing research on new therapeutic modalities for women with PCOS. In this minireview, we assessed the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of selected adjunctive agents (metformin, statins, resveratrol, melatonin, and inositols) for the treatment of women with PCOS. Metformin is a safe medication used in PCOS for 25 years that is currently recommended in select PCOS subpopulations, such as adolescents, women with metabolic disorders, and infertility infertile women undergoing ovarian hyperstimulation. Statins are also suggested in PCOS therapy, as these compounds decrease testosterone concentrations, improve lipid profiles, and ameliorate inflammatory reactions. Despite promising results, the role of statins in PCOS management needs to be further validated. Dietary supplements have also been tested in PCOS patients. Resveratrol was shown to decrease total testosterone production and improve fasting insulin but, until recently, only in one randomized study. Data on the therapeutic efficacy of melatonin and inositols on endocrine and metabolic abnormalities are limited and inconclusive. The multifactorial etiology of PCOS makes tailoring of its treatment more demanding, and there is a constant need for causative and effective modes of PCOS therapy.\nCopyright © 2019.

Because of the involvement of multiple pathways and the lack of common clues, PCOS demonstrates multifactorial properties and heterogeneity of symptoms. Recent studies have demonstrated that the core etiology and primary endocrine characteristics of PCOS are hyperandrogenemia (HA) and insulin resistance (IR). HA and IR are the main causes of PCOS and they can interplay each other in the occurrence and development of PCOS. Just because of this, the study about the effects of HA and IR on pathophysiology of various related symptoms of PCOS is very important to understand the pathogenesis of PCOS. This paper reviews the main symptoms of PCOS, including neuroendocrine disorders, reproductive processes, dyslipidemia, obesity, hypertension, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and sleep disordered breathing, which seriously affect the physical and mental health of PCOS women. The increasing knowledge of the development pattern of HA and IR in PCOS suggests that changes in diet and lifestyle, and the discovery of potential therapeutic agents may improve PCOS. However, further studies are needed to clarify the mutual influence and relation of HA and IR in development of PCOS. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge about the effects of HA and IR on PCOS.\nCopyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

A reduction in plasma sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), a transport carrier that binds estrogen and androgens and regulates their biological activities, is often used as an indicator of hyperandrogenism in women with PCOS. Low serum SHBG levels are considered a biomarker of abnormal metabolism and are related to insulin resistance (IR), compensatory hyperinsulinemia and abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism in PCOS patients. SHBG is also associated with the long-term prognosis of PCOS. SHBG gene polymorphism is correlated with the risk of PCOS. As SHBG plays a vital role in the occurrence and development of PCOS, knowledge regarding its role in PCOS is helpful for further understanding the molecular mechanism of SHBG in PCOS development and providing new ideas for the treatment of female infertility. Hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α (HNF-4α) is a vital transcription factor in the SHBG synthesis process. HNF-4α binds to the cis-type element DR1 in the SHBG promoter to initiate transcription and regulates hepatic SHBG levels by modulating glucose and lipid metabolism and inflammatory factors. However, it remains unclear whether HNF-4α is indirectly involved in the pathogenesis of PCOS via regulation of hepatic SHBG synthesis. Therefore, this review discusses the interaction between SHBG and the various complications of PCOS as well as the regulatory effect of HNF-4α on SHBG expression.\nCopyright © 2019.

The data were analysed with simple descriptive statistics and were reported as frequencies and percentages.\nRESULTS:\nDuring the 5-year period, there were a total of 93 ectopic pregnancies, 10,401 deliveries and 3399 gynaecological admissions in the hospital. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy was 0.89% of all deliveries and 2.74% of all the gynaecological admissions. The majority of the patients were in the age group of 26-30 years, and significant number of the affected them were nulliparous, 30 (32.3%). Furthermore, majority of the patients had past history of sexually transmitted diseases 48 (51.6%), multiple sexual partners 40 (43.0%) and induced abortions. Abdominal pains, amenorrhoea and vaginal bleeding were the most common presenting complaints.

One great concern of pregnancy of unknown location is that they are cases of ectopic pregnancy whose diagnosis might be postponed. Transvaginal ultrasound is able to identify an ectopic pregnancy with a sensitivity ranging from 87% to 94% and a specificity ranging from 94% to 99%. A patient with pregnancy of unknown location should be followed up until an outcome is obtained. The only valid biomarkers with clinical application and validation are serum levels of the beta fraction of hCG and progesterone. A single serum dosage of hCG is used only to determine whether the value obtained is above or below the discriminatory zone, that means the value of serum hCG above which an intrauterine gestational sac should be visible on ultrasound. Serum progesterone levels are a satisfactory marker of pregnancy viability, but they are unable to predict the location of a pregnancy of unknown location: levels below 5 ng/mL are associated with nonviable gestations, whereas levels above 20 ng/mL are correlated with viable intrauterine pregnancies. Most cases are low risk and can be monitored by expectant management with transvaginal ultrasound and serial serum hCG levels, in addition to the serum progesterone levels.

As a complication in approximately 1‑2% of all pregnancies, ectopic pregnancies may cause catastrophic hemorrhage as a result of invading maternal blood vessels. Therefore, early diagnosis and timely treatment are crucial for women with ectopic pregnancy. In this study, we aimed to identify and determine the efficacy of serum biomarkers for the prompt diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. For this purpose, the serum concentrations of progesterone, β human chorionic gonadotropin (β‑hCG) and cancer antigen‑125 (CA125) were detected by solid‑phase, competitive binding chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassays. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the percentage of CD3+ T cells in women with ectopic pregnancy. Pathological analysis of tubal and villus tissues was performed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. After receiving an injection of methotrexate (MTX), patients were examined by transvaginal ultrasound to detect the size of the echogenic mass. The results revealed that the serum levels of progesterone, β‑HCG and CA125 were significantly decreased in women with ectopic pregnancy, whereas the percentage of CD3+ T cells was increased in women with ectopic pregnancy. Histopathological examination revealed blood clots with small tissue fragments of a tubal‑type epithelium and incomplete pile structures. Five days after the MTX injection, an echogenic mass was found with a size of 1.7x1.2x1.6 cm that contained a gestational sac‑like structure and a yolk sac. On the whole, the findings of this study indicate the at the joint detection of progesterone, β‑HCG, CA125 serum levels and the CD3+ T cell percentage could be applied as a reliable indicator for the early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on data collected from 154 patients with CSP who were treated by HIFU followed by USg-D&C in Suining Central Hospital between January 2015 and January 2018. Among them, 28 patients wanted to conceive following treatment. Baseline characteristics, treatment results, intraoperative hemorrhages during USg-D&C, post-curettage serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) levels and vaginal bleeding were investigated. Subsequent pregnancy outcomes, including intervals between pregnancy and treatment of CSP, complications during pregnancy, and outcomes of newborns were evaluated. Results: All patients with CSP were successfully treated by HIFU combined with USg-D&C. Of the 28 CSP patients who intended to conceive after the treatment, 23 patients (82.14%) successfully conceived. The average interval between conception and HIFU treatment was 18.38 ± 10.04 months. Eighteen patients (78.26%) had an intrauterine pregnancy, in which 12 had delivery by cesarean section, 1 had an ongoing pregnancy, and 5 had an abortion in the first trimester. Among the other 5 women, 3 had tubal ectopic pregnancy and 2 had recurrent CSP. These five patients underwent laparoscopy within the first trimester.

Levonorgestrel (LNG) only emergency contraceptive pill is a well-established emergency contraceptive pill that is administered within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse. This study aimed at determining whether or not there is a significant association between levonorgestrel emergency contraceptive use and the occurrence of ectopic pregnancy.\nMETHODS:\ncase-control (1:3) study among 79 women with ectopic pregnancy (cases) matched against 237 women without (controls) at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret, Kenya; Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected using a questionnaire. Association between ectopic pregnancy and LNG-EC was assessed using Pearson chi-square test. The relationship between outcome and exposure (while adjusting for confounders) was assessed using logistic regression model.\nRESULTS:\nThe mean age was 27.15 years. Both cases and controls were similar by age (p = 0.990), educational level (p = 0.850), marital status (p = 0.559), employment status (p = 0.186) and parity (p = 0.999). Seventy-eight (24.7%) participants had a history of miscarriage. A higher proportion of the cases had history of using LNG-EC compared to the controls (32.9% vs. 7.2%, p < 0.001). The use of LNG-EC portended more than nine times increased odds of ectopic pregnancy compared to other contraceptive methods {OR = 9.34 (95% CI: 3.9 - 16.0)}.\nCONCLUSION:\nlevonorgestrel only emergency contraceptive use was associated with ectopic pregnancy. One of the limitations of this study is that we could not control for all confounders of ectopic pregnancy."}]
